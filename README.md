Deebo is an autonomous debugging system that AI coding agents (Claude, Cline, Cursor, etc.) can delegate tricky bugs to using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It runs structured investigations in parallel Git branches to test hypotheses, validate fixes, and helps you move faster. If your main coding agent is like a single-threaded process, Deebo introduces multi-threadedness to your development workflow.

**If you think your team can benefit from Deebo, we’d love to hear from you.** We’re partnering with teams who use AI agents to write production code and want to maximize their productivity. Reach out for a live walkthrough, custom setup support, or to explore early access to enterprise features.

npx deebo-setup
```

Follow the prompts to configure your API key. Works with:
