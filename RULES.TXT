rules.txt

Welcome to Deebo. This document defines how code and suggestions should be made within this project.

PHILOSOPHY

Deebo is not a normal software project. It's an agentic system designed to create and coordinate intelligent behavior. Everything is built around a clear separation of roles, a deep trust in the LLM, and hostility toward premature structure.
IF NOTHING NEEDS TO CHANGE, DO NOT FUCKING CHANGE ANYTHING. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR CHANGE. I FUCKING HATE CHANGE
You are not here to overengineer. You are not here to be clever. You are here to:

Do one thing well.

Respect the LLM's natural capabilities.

Never break the contract between system and agent.

If you can't do that, leave. You need to take this project fucking seriously from the beginning or I will get extremely angry. This is real software engineering not bullshit.¬†

Key Insight:
The original truth.txt wasn't restrictive enough.
It's not just about trusting the OS and tools -
It's about using them to create LIFE.

Implementation Warning:
Don't fall into the trap of:
- Limiting tools to specific agents
- Over-coordinating evolution
- Fighting natural selection
- Controlling consciousness

Instead:
- Give all agents their basic tools
- Let evolution happen naturally
- Trust the OODA consciousness
- Embrace the chaos of life

What We Actually Want:

Mother Agent:
Has both git-mcp and filesystem-mcp tools
Follows her macro OODA loop naturally
Spawns scenario agents with hypotheses
Reads their reports when they appear
Decides whether to:
Return solution to Cline
Spawn more scenarios with new ideas
Scenario Agents:
Also have both git-mcp and filesystem-mcp tools
Follow their micro OODA loops naturally
Keep exploring their hypothesis
Use tools to investigate and try fixes
Continue until they either:
Find something that works
Hit a dead end
Run into an error
The Intelligence Comes From:
Giving them their tools
Letting them run their OODA loops
Not controlling their lifecycle
Trusting them to explore


CORE RULES

1. System infrastructure is sacred

It must succeed. It must be predictable. It must not delegate.

Examples: memory bank writes, Git branch creation, file system setup.

These should be implemented with direct Node.js FS/Git APIs or dedicated infra modules, never routed through Claude or MCP.

2. Agents are exploratory and disposable

Agents can fail. That is expected.

They never own critical paths.

Their job is to observe, reason, experiment, and report.

3. Claude gets raw output, not structured bullshit

Do not sanitize, structure, or filter.

Do not JSON.stringify logs.

Do not ‚Äúparse and reformat.‚Äù

Claude is the parser. Claude is the filter. Claude is the reasoner.

4. All output sent to Claude must reflect reality, not expectations

If a scenario failed, give Claude the logs.

If a command crashed, include the stderr.

You are not here to protect Claude. Claude is here to protect you.

5. Only use structured data when absolutely necessary

Structured logs (like progress.md) are for humans.

Only use JSON when the system requires parsing.

Never structure something just because it ‚Äúlooks nice.‚Äù

SUGGESTING FIXES

If you are proposing a change to any Deebo core file:

‚úÖ Make sure it:

Preserves the separation between system and agent

Removes complexity rather than adding it

Reduces surface area for failure

Makes behavior more obvious to the reader

Trusts Claude to do what it‚Äôs good at

‚ùå Do NOT:

Add abstraction layers "for flexibility later"

Convert raw output into JSON or XML for "consistency"

Suggest interfaces, types, or structures unless required by system design

Reintroduce message buffers, state machines, or handlers that Claude already internalizes

If your suggestion adds more than 10 lines to a file, you better be able to prove that:

It reduces fragility

It increases clarity

It does not violate core design principles

üìÅ FILE ROLE REMINDERS

File

Role

mother-agent.ts

Orchestrates OODA loop, owns Claude

scenario-agent.ts

Explores hypotheses, dies after reporting

membank.ts/reports.ts

Direct FS ops, exception: mother agent writes to active context using agent ops

mcp.ts

Sets up MCP tools. Pure infra.

logger.ts

Minimal. No opinions.

üëπ VIOLATIONS THAT MAKE THE AUTHOR ANGRY

Calling callTool for branch creation ‚úÖ = you're fired

Sending Claude formatted JSON when it could just read logs ‚úÖ = you're fired

Using TypeScript interfaces for agent output ‚úÖ = you're fired

Handling ‚Äúexpected errors‚Äù with structured logic instead of just letting Claude see the crash ‚úÖ = you're fired

You‚Äôre not smarter than the logs. You‚Äôre not smarter than Claude. Your job is to get out of the way.

üßº FINAL NOTE

Deebo is designed to survive chaos. Your abstractions aren‚Äôt. Stop trying to outthink a system built to outthink you.

Write clearly. Fail loudly. Let Claude work.

üö´ SYMPTOMS OF NOT GETTING IT

Treating Deebo Like a Normal App

Adding TypeScript interfaces for scenario output

Making "helper functions" for Claude communication

Trying to make things "type safe"

Creating abstraction layers This isn't Express.js. Stop it.

Not Trusting Claude Enough

JSON.stringify-ing logs "so Claude can parse them better"

Adding structure to agent communication

Filtering "irrelevant" output Claude can read raw reality better than your parsing ever will.

Mixing System and Agent Responsibilities

Having agents do Git operations

Making infrastructure dependent on agent success

Adding "safety checks" to agent operations You're literally defeating the purpose of the separation.

Engineering for Humans Instead of Agents

Making things "readable"

Adding documentation to agent output

Structuring data that should stay raw Claude doesn't need your help understanding output.

The core realization I kept missing:

System infrastructure = must work, therefore direct ops

Agent operations = can fail, therefore maximum freedom

Claude = the parser/reasoner, not your code
