Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents

I'll start investigating this stream handling deadlock issue in the mother agent. Let me check the current code and form initial hypotheses.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/mother-agent.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for the file contents, I'll generate an initial hypothesis based on the error description:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent may be using a blocking .wait() or similar call on stdout/stderr streams of child processes, but the streams aren't being properly closed by the scenario agents, causing the mother to hang indefinitely waiting for an "end" event that never comes.
</hypothesis>

Let me check the memory bank to see if there's relevant context from previous debugging:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/7d4cacd8ed6f/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me form another hypothesis while waiting for the files:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent might be using Promise.all() to wait for multiple stream processing promises, but if any scenario agent crashes without properly closing its streams, the promise never resolves, causing the entire mother agent to hang.
</hypothesis>

I'll also check recent code changes that might have introduced this issue:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents

I'll start investigating this hanging issue right away. Let me first check the current state of the mother-agent.ts file and recent changes.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/mother-agent.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for the file contents, I'll generate an initial hypothesis based on the context provided:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent may be waiting indefinitely for some event or response from scenario agents that never comes, causing a deadlock. Since stream handling is working fine, the issue likely involves:
1. Missing or incorrect cleanup of scenario agent processes
2. An unresolved Promise in the communication between mother and scenario agents
3. Event listeners that aren't properly removed
</hypothesis>

Let me also check if there are any relevant recent changes:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me look at the memory bank to see what's been tried:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/7d4cacd8ed6f/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

This will give me a better picture of the situation. Once I have this information, I can refine my hypothesis and suggest specific areas to investigate. I'm particularly interested in:

1. How scenario agents are spawned and managed
2. The event handling architecture
3. Any Promise chains or async/await patterns that could cause hanging

Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents

I'll start investigating the mother agent hanging issue by examining the core logic. Let me first check the current memory bank context and then look at the mother-agent.ts file.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/7d4cacd8ed6f/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/mother-agent.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the initial context, I'll generate my first hypothesis about the hanging issue:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent is hanging because it's getting stuck in an infinite OODA loop when processing scenario reports. This could happen if:
1. The completion condition logic is faulty - not properly detecting when all scenarios have reported
2. The state management around active scenarios is inconsistent
3. There's a race condition where a scenario completion event is missed

This would explain why it hangs after spawning scenarios rather than cleanly concluding the investigation.
</hypothesis>

Let me examine the mother-agent.ts file's OODA loop implementation to verify this. I'm particularly interested in:
1. How it tracks active scenarios
2. The completion detection logic
3. The state transitions in the OODA loop

Could you show me the specific sections of mother-agent.ts that handle:
1. The main OODA loop implementation
2. Scenario completion handling
3. The investigation conclusion logic

This will help me refine my hypothesis or generate new ones based on the actual implementation.

Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents

Based on the mother-agent.ts code and the scenario timeout message, I'm generating a refined hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent is hanging because of a fundamental flaw in how scenario agent processes are tracked and cleaned up:

1. The scenario completion detection relies on counting stdout/stderr 'close' events
2. The `closed` counter in the Promise resolution logic requires exactly 2 close events (one each for stdout/stderr)
3. If a scenario times out and is killed via `child.kill()`, the streams may not cleanly close, leaving the Promise unresolved
4. This causes the mother agent to wait indefinitely for scenario results that will never come

Critical code section:
```typescript
return new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  let closed = 0;
  const maybeResolve = () => {
    if (closed === 2) resolve(output);
  };
  // ... stream close handlers ...
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (closed < 2) {
      output += '\nScenario timeout';
      child.kill();
      resolve(output);
    }
  }, SCENARIO_TIMEOUT);
});
```
</hypothesis>

Let me verify this by checking what happens to active scenarios after timeouts:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/scenario-agent.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

I suspect the fix needs to:
1. Ensure proper cleanup of child processes after timeout
2. Use process.kill(child.pid, 'SIGTERM') instead of child.kill() for more reliable termination
3. Add cleanup handlers for the 'exit' event in addition to stream closes
4. Modify the activeScenarios tracking to handle timeout cases

Would you like me to generate specific code changes to implement these fixes?

Error: Tool operations are failing silently and in unpredictable orders after performance optimization. Sometimes later operations complete even when earlier dependent operations failed.

I'll start investigating this asynchronous operation issue right away. Let me first check the memory bank to see what's been tried and form initial hypotheses.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/7d4cacd8ed6f/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While that loads, I'll form my first hypothesis based on the error description:

<hypothesis>
The performance optimization likely introduced parallel execution of tool operations without proper await chains or Promise.all handling, causing race conditions in the execution order. The tool operations are probably being fired off concurrently without waiting for dependencies to complete successfully.
</hypothesis>

Let me check the relevant code:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype",
      "pattern": "*.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also check recent changes that might have introduced this issue:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the error symptoms, I'm forming additional hypotheses:

<hypothesis>
The tool execution system may be using Promise.all() for performance but not properly handling rejected promises, allowing the remaining operations to continue even when earlier ones fail.
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
The optimization might have removed or broken error propagation in the Promise chain, causing failures to be swallowed instead of triggering proper error handling.
</hypothesis>

Let me check the specific tool execution implementation:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_multiple_files</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "paths": [
        "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/tools/toolExecutor.ts",
        "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/tools/toolManager.ts"
      ]
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Please share the results of these queries so I can refine my hypotheses and propose a specific solution. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the tool execution was modified for performance optimization.
