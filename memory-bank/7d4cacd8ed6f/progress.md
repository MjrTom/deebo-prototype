Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents
Based on the code examination and scenario results, I can now provide a clear solution:

<solution>
The mother agent is hanging due to improper stream handling in the scenario agent spawning code. Specifically:

1. Root Cause: The stream handling code in `mother-agent.ts` uses a problematic pattern where it waits for both stdout and stderr to close without proper error handling or timeouts:

```typescript
let output = '';
child.stdout.on('data', data => output += data);
child.stderr.on('data', data => output += data);

return new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  let closed = 0;
  const maybeResolve = () => {
    if (closed === 2) resolve(output);
  };
```

2. Fix: Replace the current stream handling with a more robust pattern:

```typescript
return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
  const streams = [child.stdout, child.stderr];
  const output: string[] = ['', ''];
  
  streams.forEach((stream, i) => {
    stream.on('data', (data) => output[i] += data.toString());
    stream.on('error', reject);
  });

  child.on('close', (code) => {
    if (code === 0) {
      resolve(output.join(''));
    } else {
      reject(new Error(`Process exited with code ${code}`));
    }
  });

  child.on('error', reject);

  // Global timeout
  setTimeout(() => {
    child.kill();
    reject(new Error('Scenario timeout'));
  }, SCENARIO_TIMEOUT);
});
```

Key improvements:
1. Uses process 'close' event instead of counting stream closes
2. Proper error propagation from both streams and process
3. Clean process termination on timeout
4. No reliance on stream 'close' events which can hang
5. Handles both successful and error cases explicitly

This solution addresses both confirmed hypotheses about stream handling and Promise.all() issues. The timeout mechanism ensures the mother agent can't hang indefinitely, and proper error handling ensures crashed scenarios don't leave orphaned promises.

Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents
Looking at the code and error pattern, I can now formulate a more specific hypothesis about the hanging issue:

<hypothesis>
The problem lies in the Promise resolution logic for scenario agents. In the code around line 279-308, the Promise resolution depends on both stdout and stderr streams closing (closed === 2), but there's a race condition with the error handlers. If an error occurs after one stream closes but before the other, the Promise may never resolve despite the timeout. Specific issues:

1. The `closed` counter isn't atomic and could be incorrectly incremented
2. Error handlers don't properly trigger Promise resolution
3. The timeout kills the process but doesn't ensure stream cleanup
</hypothesis>

Let me check some specific code patterns. Let's look at any related scenario agent code:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/scenario-agent.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Looking at the mother-agent.ts code more closely, I see this critical section:

```typescript
return new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  let closed = 0;
  const maybeResolve = () => {
    if (closed === 2) resolve(output);
  };

  child.stdout.on('close', () => {
    closed++;
    maybeResolve();
  });
  
  child.stderr.on('close', () => {
    closed++;
    maybeResolve();
  });
```

<hypothesis>
The hanging is caused by a Promise resolution deadlock when streams close out of order or errors occur. Here's the specific flow:
1. One stream (e.g. stdout) closes normally
2. An error occurs on the process
3. The error handler fires but doesn't increment `closed`
4. The second stream never closes
5. `closed` never reaches 2
6. Promise never resolves despite timeout killing process

The solution needs to ensure Promise resolution in ALL cases - normal closure, errors, and timeouts.
</hypothesis>

I can now propose a specific solution:

<solution>
The mother-agent.ts needs to be modified to handle stream closure more robustly. Here's the fix:

1. Replace the stream handling code with this updated version:

```typescript
return new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  let isResolved = false;
  const forceResolve = () => {
    if (!isResolved) {
      isResolved = true;
      child.kill(); // Ensure process is terminated
      resolve(output);
    }
  };

  // Handle normal stream closure
  let closed = 0;
  const checkClosed = () => {
    closed++;
    if (closed >= 2) forceResolve();
  };

  child.stdout.on('close', checkClosed);
  child.stderr.on('close', checkClosed);

  // Handle all error cases
  child.on('error', (err) => {
    output += `\nProcess error: ${err}`;
    forceResolve();
  });

  child.stdout.on('error', (err) => {
    output += `\nStdout error: ${err}`;
    checkClosed(); // Count as closed on error
  });

  child.stderr.on('error', (err) => {
    output += `\nStderr error: ${err}`;
    checkClosed(); // Count as closed on error
  });

  // Handle process exit
  child.on('exit', () => {
    setTimeout(forceResolve, 100); // Give streams brief chance to flush
  });

  // Global timeout
  setTimeout(forceResolve, SCENARIO_TIMEOUT);
});
```

This solution:
1. Uses a single point of resolution with forceResolve()
2. Counts stream errors as closures
3. Adds process exit handler with flush time
4. Ensures timeout always resolves
5. Prevents multiple resolutions
6. Guarantees process cleanup

The fix maintains all existing functionality while preventing hanging by ensuring the Promise always resolves, streams are properly cleaned up, and the process is terminated in all cases.

Error: Mother agent hangs after spawning scenario agents
Based on the evidence and scenario timeout, I'm generating a new hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The mother agent is hanging because of a deadlock in its OODA loop decision-making process:

1. The mother agent continues its OODA loop until it finds a `<solution>` tag in Claude's response
2. The logic for processing scenario results and generating new hypotheses appears to have a flaw:
```typescript
while (!getMessageText(conversation).includes('<solution>')) {
  // Process scenario outputs
  messages.push({ role: 'user', content: scenarioOutputs.join('\n') });
  
  // Get next Claude response
  conversation = await anthropic.messages.create({...});
}
```

The issue is:
- When scenarios timeout or fail, their output is added to the message history
- But the mother agent doesn't have logic to:
  a) Process failed scenarios differently from successful ones
  b) Generate new hypotheses when scenarios fail
  c) Determine when to give up and conclude no solution exists
</hypothesis>

Let's verify this by looking at the key decision points in mother-agent.ts:

1. The main while loop condition only checks for `<solution>` tags
2. There's no logic to handle failed scenario cases differently
3. No mechanism to detect when all reasonable hypotheses have been exhausted

Suggested fixes:

1. Add explicit state tracking:
```typescript
interface ScenarioResult {
  id: string;
  status: 'success' | 'timeout' | 'error';
  output: string;
}

const scenarioResults = new Map<string, ScenarioResult>();
```

2. Add failure analysis logic:
```typescript
function shouldGenerateNewHypothesis(results: ScenarioResult[]): boolean {
  const allFailed = results.every(r => r.status !== 'success');
  const hasTimeout = results.some(r => r.status === 'timeout');
  return allFailed || hasTimeout;
}
```

3. Add investigation termination conditions:
```typescript
const MAX_FAILED_HYPOTHESES = 5;
let failedHypothesesCount = 0;

// In the main loop:
if (shouldGenerateNewHypothesis(Array.from(scenarioResults.values()))) {
  failedHypothesesCount++;
  if (failedHypothesesCount >= MAX_FAILED_HYPOTHESES) {
    return `<solution>No solution found after ${failedHypothesesCount} failed hypotheses</solution>`;
  }
}
```

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes? This would prevent the hanging by ensuring the mother agent can:
1. Track scenario outcomes explicitly
2. Make informed decisions about generating new hypotheses
3. Know when to conclude the investigation has failed
