Since stream handling is working fine, the issue likely involves:\n1. Missing or incorrect cleanup of scenario agent processes\n2. An unresolved Promise in the communication between mother and scenario agents\n3. Event listeners that aren't properly removed\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Focused on process management and Promise resolution, avoiding stream handling which was confirmed working\n- Analyzed communication patterns between mother and scenario agents\n- Found several critical issues in process management and Promise resolution\n\nKey findings:\n1. Mother agent is creating Promises for scenario agent completion but not properly handling rejection cases\n2. No timeout mechanism exists for scenario agent responses\n3. Process cleanup is triggered but might not complete due to unresolved Promises\n4. Event listeners for inter-process communication aren't being cleaned up consistently\n\nThe code shows a classic case of Promise chains that can remain unresolved if a scenario agent fails silently or exits unexpectedly. The mother agent continues waiting for resolution that never comes.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added timeout mechanism for scenario agent responses\n2. Implemented proper Promise rejection handling\n3. Added cleanup for orphaned event listeners\n4. Implemented process termination confirmation\n\nThese changes ensure that:\n- No Promise can remain unresolved indefinitely\n- Failed processes are properly cleaned up\n- Event listeners are removed when no longer needed\n- Mother agent can recover from scenario agent failures\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe investigation directly revealed issues matching the hypothesis:\n- Found multiple instances of unhandled Promise rejections\n- Discovered event listeners that weren't being properly cleaned up\n- Identified missing process termination confirmation\nThe fixes address the core issues while maintaining the working stream handling.\n\nScenario timeout"}],"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-03T06:45:37.116Z","agent":"mother","level":"debug","message":"Received from Claude","data":{"response":"Looking at the code and error pattern, I can now formulate a more specific hypothesis about the hanging issue:\n\n<hypothesis>\nThe problem lies in the Promise resolution logic for scenario agents. In the code around line 279-308, the Promise resolution depends on both stdout and stderr streams closing (closed === 2), but there's a race condition with the error handlers. If an error occurs after one stream closes but before the other, the Promise may never resolve despite the timeout. Specific issues:\n\n1. The `closed` counter isn't atomic and could be incorrectly incremented\n2. Error handlers don't properly trigger Promise resolution\n3. The timeout kills the process but doesn't ensure stream cleanup\n</hypothesis>\n\nLet me check some specific code patterns. Let's look at any related scenario agent code:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/src/scenario-agent.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nLooking at the mother-agent.ts code more closely, I see this critical section:\n\n```typescript\nreturn new Promise<string>((resolve) => {\n  let closed = 0;\n  const maybeResolve = () => {\n    if (closed === 2) resolve(output);\n  };\n\n  child.stdout.on('close', () => {\n    closed++;\n    maybeResolve();\n  });\n  \n  child.stderr.on('close', () => {\n    closed++;\n    maybeResolve();\n  });\n```\n\n<hypothesis>\nThe hanging is caused by a Promise resolution deadlock when streams close out of order or errors occur. Here's the specific flow:\n1. One stream (e.g. stdout) closes normally\n2. An error occurs on the process\n3. The error handler fires but doesn't increment `closed`\n4. The second stream never closes\n5. `closed` never reaches 2\n6. Promise never resolves despite timeout killing process\n\nThe solution needs to ensure Promise resolution in ALL cases - normal closure, errors, and timeouts.\n</hypothesis>\n\nI can now propose a specific solution:\n\n<solution>\nThe mother-agent.ts needs to be modified to handle stream closure more robustly. Here's the fix:\n\n1. Replace the stream handling code with this updated version:\n\n```typescript\nreturn new Promise<string>((resolve) => {\n  let isResolved = false;\n  const forceResolve = () => {\n    if (!isResolved) {\n      isResolved = true;\n      child.kill(); // Ensure process is terminated\n      resolve(output);\n    }\n  };\n\n  // Handle normal stream closure\n  let closed = 0;\n  const checkClosed = () => {\n    closed++;\n    if (closed >= 2) forceResolve();\n  };\n\n  child.stdout.on('close', checkClosed);\n  child.stderr.on('close', checkClosed);\n\n  // Handle all error cases\n  child.on('error', (err) => {\n    output += `\\nProcess error: ${err}`;\n    forceResolve();\n  });\n\n  child.stdout.on('error', (err) => {\n    output += `\\nStdout error: ${err}`;\n    checkClosed(); // Count as closed on error\n  });\n\n  child.stderr.on('error', (err) => {\n    output += `\\nStderr error: ${err}`;\n    checkClosed(); // Count as closed on error\n  });\n\n  // Handle process exit\n  child.on('exit', () => {\n    setTimeout(forceResolve, 100); // Give streams brief chance to flush\n  });\n\n  // Global timeout\n  setTimeout(forceResolve, SCENARIO_TIMEOUT);\n});\n```\n\nThis solution:\n1. Uses a single point of resolution with forceResolve()\n2. Counts stream errors as closures\n3. Adds process exit handler with flush time\n4. Ensures timeout always resolves\n5. Prevents multiple resolutions\n6. Guarantees process cleanup\n\nThe fix maintains all existing functionality while preventing hanging by ensuring the Promise always resolves, streams are properly cleaned up, and the process is terminated in all cases.\n</solution>","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
