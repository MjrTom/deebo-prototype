The timeout handler ensures resolution regardless of stream state\n2. The context explicitly states stream handling is working correctly\n3. The hanging issue appears to be in the mother agent's decision-making logic\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - since the hypothesis was incorrect, no changes were needed.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. The code explicitly handles the timeout case by forcing promise resolution\n2. Context directly contradicts the hypothesis by ruling out stream handling\n3. The OODA loop implementation shows the issue is more likely in how the mother agent processes results and makes decisions, not in how it handles individual scenario completions\n</report>\n\nThe mother agent hanging is more likely related to:\n1. How it processes scenario results in its decision-making loop\n2. Edge cases in the OODA cycle implementation\n3. Logic determining when to continue vs conclude investigations\n\nWould you like me to investigate one of these alternative directions instead?","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
