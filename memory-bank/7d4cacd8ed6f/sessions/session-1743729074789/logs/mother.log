The commit operation succeeds and is recorded in git log\n2. Immediate git_status calls sometimes show files as modified\n3. Subsequent git_status calls (after a brief delay) show correct state\n4. File system operations are completing successfully\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n- The inconsistency only appears in immediate status checks after commit\n- The issue resolves itself after a short delay\n- Git operations are completing successfully, but status reporting is inconsistent\n- This behavior matches classic race condition patterns where operation ordering becomes non-deterministic\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created test-race-condition.txt for testing\n- Added and committed the file\n- No permanent changes were needed as this was diagnostic only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1.

The modifications appearing after commit don't show the typical patterns of line ending conversions (no CRLF↔LF changes visible in diffs)\n2. The issue's intermittent nature doesn't match with Git's line ending behavior, which would be consistent if it were the cause\n3. Line ending conversions typically happen during checkout or when files are added to the index, not after commit\n4. The timing of the issue (after performance optimizations) doesn't correlate with line ending conversion mechanisms\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Made a test commit to observe behavior\n- No permanent changes were needed as hypothesis was disproven\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- Line ending conversions in Git are deterministic and happen at specific points in the Git workflow\n- The symptom pattern (occasional post-commit modifications) doesn't match Git's line ending conversion behavior\n- The lack of CRLF↔LF conversion markers in the diffs strongly suggests this is not a line ending issue\n- The timing of the issue's appearance (after performance optimizations) suggests a different root cause related to async operations or race conditions\n\nScenario timeout\nSecure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio\nAllowed directories: [\n  '/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/7d4cacd8ed6f',\n  '/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype'\n]\nHYPOTHESIS: H3: File Handle Release Issue - The optimization might have introduced a problem with properly closing file handles after commit operations, causing Windows/OS to hold onto file locks briefly, leading to inconsistent status reports.\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the context of performance optimizations affecting Git operations\n- Conducted a controlled test with file creation, commit, and immediate status checks\n- Examined file metadata and locks\n- Checked for unstaged changes after commit\n\nKey findings:\n1. Git status reports were consistent immediately after commit operations\n2. No file handle locks were detected in the metadata\n3. The unstaged diff showed no pending changes after commit\n4. The issue appears to be unrelated to file handle releasing\n\nThe hypothesis is refuted because:\n- File operations completed cleanly without lock indicators\n- Status inconsistencies don't correlate with file handle patterns\n- The behavior doesn't match typical file locking symptoms (no access denied or sharing violation patterns)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created test-file.txt for investigation\n- Committed test file\n- These changes were temporary for testing purposes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n- File handle operations were directly observable through metadata\n- The test scenario was controlled and reproducible\n- No file locking patterns were detected\n- The symptoms don't match typical file handle release issues\n\nAlternative direction:\nThe issue might be related to Git's internal state caching or the way the optimization handles Git's index updates, rather than file handle operations.\n\nScenario timeout"},{"role":"user","content":"Scientific observation: Scientific insight: The issue seems to manifest more frequently when multiple git operations are performed in quick succession.

Git operations like commit and status have implicit ordering dependencies that are being violated by parallel execution.\n\nEvidence:\n1. Issue started after performance optimization commit\n2. Problem occurs more frequently with multiple rapid Git operations\n3. Promise.all in scenario-agent.ts is executing Git operations concurrently\n4. Issue is timing-dependent and resolves itself after brief delays\n\nFix Required:\n1. Modify scenario-agent.ts to handle Git operations sequentially while allowing other tool operations to run concurrently. Specifically:\n   - Create a separate queue/promise chain for Git operations\n   - Keep non-Git operations in the parallel Promise.all pool\n   - Ensure Git operations maintain their execution order\n\nImplementation:\n```typescript\n// Before (problematic):\nconst results = await Promise.all(toolCalls.map(tool => executeToolCall(tool)));\n\n// After (fixed):\nconst gitOps = toolCalls.filter(tool => tool.server === 'git-mcp');\nconst nonGitOps = toolCalls.filter(tool => tool.server !== 'git-mcp');\n\n// Execute Git ops sequentially\nconst gitResults = await gitOps.reduce(async (promise, op) => {\n  await promise;\n  return executeToolCall(op);\n}, Promise.resolve());\n\n// Execute non-Git ops in parallel\nconst nonGitResults = await Promise.all(nonGitOps.map(tool => executeToolCall(tool)));\n\nconst results = [...gitResults, ...nonGitResults];\n```\n\nThis solution maintains the performance benefits of parallel execution for non-Git operations while ensuring Git operations maintain their required sequential ordering.\n</solution>","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
