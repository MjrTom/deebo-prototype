The commit operation succeeds and is recorded in git log\n2. Immediate git_status calls sometimes show files as modified\n3. Subsequent git_status calls (after a brief delay) show correct state\n4. File system operations are completing successfully\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n- The inconsistency only appears in immediate status checks after commit\n- The issue resolves itself after a short delay\n- Git operations are completing successfully, but status reporting is inconsistent\n- This behavior matches classic race condition patterns where operation ordering becomes non-deterministic\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created test-race-condition.txt for testing\n- Added and committed the file\n- No permanent changes were needed as this was diagnostic only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. We were able to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment\n2. The behavior exactly matches race condition characteristics\n3. The timing-dependent nature of the issue (immediate vs delayed checks)\n4. The fact that this started after performance optimizations were introduced\n5. All Git operations are completing successfully, just reporting inconsistently\n\nRecommendation: Implement a small delay or synchronization mechanism between git_commit and subsequent git_status calls to ensure file system operations are fully complete.\n</report>","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
