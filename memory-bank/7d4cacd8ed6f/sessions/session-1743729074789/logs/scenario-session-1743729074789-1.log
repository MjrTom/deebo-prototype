The modifications appearing after commit don't show the typical patterns of line ending conversions (no CRLF↔LF changes visible in diffs)\n2. The issue's intermittent nature doesn't match with Git's line ending behavior, which would be consistent if it were the cause\n3. Line ending conversions typically happen during checkout or when files are added to the index, not after commit\n4. The timing of the issue (after performance optimizations) doesn't correlate with line ending conversion mechanisms\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Made a test commit to observe behavior\n- No permanent changes were needed as hypothesis was disproven\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- Line ending conversions in Git are deterministic and happen at specific points in the Git workflow\n- The symptom pattern (occasional post-commit modifications) doesn't match Git's line ending conversion behavior\n- The lack of CRLF↔LF conversion markers in the diffs strongly suggests this is not a line ending issue\n- The timing of the issue's appearance (after performance optimizations) suggests a different root cause related to async operations or race conditions\n</report>\n\nI recommend exploring alternative hypotheses related to:\n1. Race conditions in the new performance-optimized Git operations\n2. File system caching or async file operations\n3.
