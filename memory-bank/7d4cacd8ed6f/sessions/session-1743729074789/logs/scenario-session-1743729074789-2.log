The issue appears to be unrelated to file handle releasing\n\nThe hypothesis is refuted because:\n- File operations completed cleanly without lock indicators\n- Status inconsistencies don't correlate with file handle patterns\n- The behavior doesn't match typical file locking symptoms (no access denied or sharing violation patterns)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created test-file.txt for investigation\n- Committed test file\n- These changes were temporary for testing purposes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n- File handle operations were directly observable through metadata\n- The test scenario was controlled and reproducible\n- No file locking patterns were detected\n- The symptoms don't match typical file handle release issues\n\nAlternative direction:\nThe issue might be related to Git's internal state caching or the way the optimization handles Git's index updates, rather than file handle operations.\n</report>","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
