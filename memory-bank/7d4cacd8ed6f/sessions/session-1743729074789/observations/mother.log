{"timestamp":"2025-04-04T01:11:22.955Z","observation":"Scientific insight: The issue seems to manifest more frequently when multiple git operations are performed in quick succession. Consider investigating the timing and order of operations in the scenario agent code, particularly around commit operations."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-04T01:11:25.413Z","observation":"Investigation tip: Recent changes to scenario-agent.ts introduced concurrent execution of tool calls. This might be worth examining since Git operations often have implicit sequential dependencies."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-04T01:12:15.323Z","observation":"Scientific analysis: The scenario investigating race conditions (session-1743729074789-0) has found strong evidence that the Promise.all implementation in scenario-agent.ts is causing Git operations to execute out of order. Consider examining the recent changes that converted sequential tool execution to parallel execution."}
