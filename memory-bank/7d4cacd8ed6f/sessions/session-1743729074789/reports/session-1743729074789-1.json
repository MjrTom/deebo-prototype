"HYPOTHESIS: H2: Line Ending Conversion - Git's auto.crlf or core.autocrlf settings might be causing immediate file modifications after commit due to line ending conversions happening asynchronously during the performance optimized operations.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the current state of the repository and file modifications\n- Attempted to reproduce the issue with a test commit\n- Examined file contents and differences before and after commits\n- Looked for line ending conversion patterns in the modifications\n\nKey findings:\n1. The modifications appearing after commit don't show the typical patterns of line ending conversions (no CRLF↔LF changes visible in diffs)\n2. The issue's intermittent nature doesn't match with Git's line ending behavior, which would be consistent if it were the cause\n3. Line ending conversions typically happen during checkout or when files are added to the index, not after commit\n4. The timing of the issue (after performance optimizations) doesn't correlate with line ending conversion mechanisms\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Made a test commit to observe behavior\n- No permanent changes were needed as hypothesis was disproven\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- Line ending conversions in Git are deterministic and happen at specific points in the Git workflow\n- The symptom pattern (occasional post-commit modifications) doesn't match Git's line ending conversion behavior\n- The lack of CRLF↔LF conversion markers in the diffs strongly suggests this is not a line ending issue\n- The timing of the issue's appearance (after performance optimizations) suggests a different root cause related to async operations or race conditions"
