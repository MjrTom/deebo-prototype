"HYPOTHESIS: H3: File Handle Release Issue - The optimization might have introduced a problem with properly closing file handles after commit operations, causing Windows/OS to hold onto file locks briefly, leading to inconsistent status reports.\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the context of performance optimizations affecting Git operations\n- Conducted a controlled test with file creation, commit, and immediate status checks\n- Examined file metadata and locks\n- Checked for unstaged changes after commit\n\nKey findings:\n1. Git status reports were consistent immediately after commit operations\n2. No file handle locks were detected in the metadata\n3. The unstaged diff showed no pending changes after commit\n4. The issue appears to be unrelated to file handle releasing\n\nThe hypothesis is refuted because:\n- File operations completed cleanly without lock indicators\n- Status inconsistencies don't correlate with file handle patterns\n- The behavior doesn't match typical file locking symptoms (no access denied or sharing violation patterns)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created test-file.txt for investigation\n- Committed test file\n- These changes were temporary for testing purposes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n- File handle operations were directly observable through metadata\n- The test scenario was controlled and reproducible\n- No file locking patterns were detected\n- The symptoms don't match typical file handle release issues\n\nAlternative direction:\nThe issue might be related to Git's internal state caching or the way the optimization handles Git's index updates, rather than file handle operations."
