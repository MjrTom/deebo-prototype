The error symptoms (failing silently, operations continuing after dependency failures) are consistent with unhandled Promise rejections\n2. The timing of issues (after performance optimization) aligns with potential Promise.all() implementation\n3. The unpredictable operation order suggests parallel execution without proper synchronization\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as full code access was limited\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nRationale for confidence level:\n- The symptoms very closely match typical Promise.all() rejection handling issues\n- The timing coinciding with performance optimization strongly suggests Promise-related changes\n- Without direct access to the relevant code files, we cannot make a definitive confirmation\n- The specific pattern of failures (later operations completing despite dependent operation failures) is a classic indicator of Promise.all() rejection handling problems\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Examine the tool execution implementation for Promise.all() usage\n2. Look for missing .catch() handlers or error propagation\n3. Check for proper sequential operation enforcement for dependent tasks\n</report>\n\nThe investigation provides reasonable evidence supporting the hypothesis, though full confirmation would require access to the specific implementation files. The error pattern is very characteristic of Promise.all() rejection handling issues, especially in the context of performance optimization.","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
