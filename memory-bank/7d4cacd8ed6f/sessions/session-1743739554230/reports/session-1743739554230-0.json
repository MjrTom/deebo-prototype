"HYPOTHESIS: The performance optimization likely introduced parallel execution of tool operations without proper await chains or Promise.all handling, causing race conditions in the execution order. The tool operations are probably being fired off concurrently without waiting for dependencies to complete successfully.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the tool execution implementation after recent performance optimizations\n- Found that the recent changes replaced sequential execution with parallel processing\n- Key issues identified:\n  1. Tool operations are being initiated using Promise.all() without proper dependency checking\n  2. Error handling doesn't prevent dependent operations from executing\n  3. No proper await chain ensuring operations complete before their dependents start\n\nKey findings:\n- Found Promise.all() being used to run multiple tool operations concurrently\n- Error handling only logs errors but doesn't prevent dependent operations\n- Missing checks for operation dependencies before parallel execution\n- No mechanism to ensure operation order when dependencies exist\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was an investigation task. However, to fix this, would need to:\n1. Implement proper dependency graph traversal\n2. Add operation status tracking\n3. Ensure dependent operations wait for prerequisites\n4. Add proper error propagation to stop dependent operations when prerequisites fail\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence clearly shows the hypothesis is correct:\n- Found direct code changes introducing parallel execution\n- Identified missing dependency checks and error handling\n- Behavior matches exactly what would happen with uncontrolled parallel execution\n- The timing and ordering issues precisely match what would occur with race conditions"
