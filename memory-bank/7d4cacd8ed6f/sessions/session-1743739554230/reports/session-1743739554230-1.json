"HYPOTHESIS: The tool execution system may be using Promise.all() for performance but not properly handling rejected promises, allowing the remaining operations to continue even when earlier ones fail.\nCONFIRMED: Partially\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the codebase structure and recent changes\n- Looked for tool execution related files and changes\n- Searched for execution-related patterns\n- Key context considered: Operations failing silently and continuing after dependencies fail, which strongly suggests Promise handling issues\n- Limited access to actual code content makes full confirmation difficult\n\nKey findings:\n1. The error symptoms (failing silently, operations continuing after dependency failures) are consistent with unhandled Promise rejections\n2. The timing of issues (after performance optimization) aligns with potential Promise.all() implementation\n3. The unpredictable operation order suggests parallel execution without proper synchronization\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as full code access was limited\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nRationale for confidence level:\n- The symptoms very closely match typical Promise.all() rejection handling issues\n- The timing coinciding with performance optimization strongly suggests Promise-related changes\n- Without direct access to the relevant code files, we cannot make a definitive confirmation\n- The specific pattern of failures (later operations completing despite dependent operation failures) is a classic indicator of Promise.all() rejection handling problems\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Examine the tool execution implementation for Promise.all() usage\n2. Look for missing .catch() handlers or error propagation\n3. Check for proper sequential operation enforcement for dependent tasks"
