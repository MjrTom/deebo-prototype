"HYPOTHESIS: The optimization might have removed or broken error propagation in the Promise chain, causing failures to be swallowed instead of triggering proper error handling.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed recent optimization changes in the codebase\n- Focused on Promise chain handling and tool execution logic\n- Found that the optimization converted sequential Promise chains to parallel execution\n- Key issue: Promise.all() was used without proper error handling wrapper\n\nKey findings:\n1. The optimization changed sequential .then() chains to parallel Promise.all()\n2. No .catch() handlers were added to individual Promises in the parallel execution\n3. Missing error boundary around Promise.all() allowed some promises to complete even after others failed\n4. Race conditions introduced by parallel execution without proper synchronization\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added error boundary around Promise.all()\n2. Implemented proper error propagation for individual promises\n3. Restored operation order guarantees through dependency chain\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- Clear evidence in code changes showing removed error handling\n- Symptoms exactly match what happens when Promise errors are swallowed\n- Parallel execution without proper error boundaries is a known cause of this behavior\n- Test cases confirm the issue is fixed when proper error handling is restored"
