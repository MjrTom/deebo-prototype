"HYPOTHESIS: The previous modification to `block_finalize` regarding SINK UOp placement has created a scenario where either the SINK node is prematurely removed, incorrectly positioned, or another node is added after the intended SINK node, thus violating the structural requirement that the UOp graph terminates with a SINK.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the codebase for SINK UOp handling and block finalization logic\n- Analyzed recent changes and modifications to block_finalize\n- Reviewed test cases and assertions related to SINK placement\n- Found that while the SINK node is being added, the assertion failure suggests it's not maintaining its position as the final node\n\nKey findings:\n1. The block_finalize function appears to be adding the SINK node correctly\n2. However, there seems to be an issue with either:\n   a) Additional nodes being appended after the SINK node\n   b) The SINK node being moved from its terminal position during optimization or transformation passes\n3. The assertion checking for SINK as the final node is triggering, indicating the invariant is being violated\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made as this was an investigative session to validate the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nReasoning for confidence level:\n- Clear evidence of the SINK node placement issue through assertion failure\n- Identified potential causes for the violation\n- However, without more detailed runtime analysis or debugging output, can't pinpoint exact point of failure\n- Need to investigate transformation passes that might be affecting node ordering after SINK placement\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Add debug logging around SINK node placement in block_finalize\n2. Verify no transformation passes are running after block_finalize\n3. Add checks to prevent any node additions after SINK placement\n4. Consider adding node order validation at key points in the pipeline"
