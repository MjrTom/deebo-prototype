"HYPOTHESIS: The assertion check that fails (`doesn't end with SINK`) is located within or immediately after the `block_finalize` function call site, or within a graph optimization/validation function called by `block_finalize`, and the error message itself is dynamically generated, hence the failed search.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined all references to block_finalize in the codebase\n- Searched for SINK-related assertions and validations\n- Looked for graph validation functions\n- Searched for the exact error message\n- Analyzed recent changes in the codebase\n\nKey findings:\n1. The exact error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" doesn't appear in the codebase as a static string, suggesting it's indeed dynamically generated\n2. However, the hypothesis about the location is incorrect. The search results reveal that SINK-related validations are more commonly found in:\n   - Graph traversal functions\n   - UOp validation utilities\n   - Block optimization passes\n3. The assertion is likely part of a broader graph validation system rather than being specifically tied to block_finalize\n4. The error suggests a validation rule that checks if certain blocks or sequences terminate with a SINK operation, but this check appears to be happening in a different context than block_finalize\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This was an investigative task to verify the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Comprehensive code search results show clear patterns of where SINK-related validations occur\n2. The absence of the exact error message in static form, combined with the presence of various SINK-related validations elsewhere, strongly indicates the hypothesis was incorrect about the location\n3. The search covered all relevant areas including block processing, graph validation, and optimization passes\n4. The context provided about the previous fix attempt aligns with our findings that the issue is more related to general graph processing than specifically block_finalize"
