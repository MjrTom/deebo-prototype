"HYPOTHESIS: The logic for ensuring a block ends with a SINK node exists, but the function responsible is not named `block_finalize`. The failure occurs because an optimization pass runs after this finalization step and doesn't preserve the SINK node's terminal position.\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI focused my investigation on:\n1. Searching for block finalization and SINK node related code\n2. Looking for optimization passes that might affect block structure\n3. Examining verification/assertion logic\n4. Checking recent changes in the codebase\n\nKey findings:\n1. The error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" appears to come from a verification step, not from the block finalization process itself\n2. No evidence was found of optimization passes that run after block finalization\n3. The search results show that block structure handling is more fundamental to the IR generation process, rather than being a post-processing step\n\nThe hypothesis appears incorrect for several reasons:\n- The error manifests as an assertion failure during verification, suggesting the SINK node is missing entirely rather than being moved out of position\n- No evidence was found of optimization passes that would modify block structure after finalization\n- The problem appears to be more basic - the SINK node isn't being properly added in the first place, rather than being moved by an optimization\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on validating/invalidating the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The error message clearly indicates a missing SINK node (assertion failure) rather than a misplaced one\n2. No evidence was found of optimization passes that could affect block structure in this way\n3. The search results strongly suggest this is a block construction issue rather than an optimization issue\n4. This aligns with the context that the previous fix attempt was related to SINK UOp placement directly, not optimization passes"
