"HYPOTHESIS: The code responsible for the `SINK` node logic and the assertion might be within a compiled JavaScript file (`.js`) or another file type if the project structure involves multiple languages or build steps, thus evading the `*.ts` search.\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined project structure for compiled JS files and build configurations\n- Searched for SINK references across all file types\n- Looked for test files that might contain assertions\n- Checked build configurations and scripts\n- Attempted to locate compiled/distribution directories\n\nKey findings:\n1. No significant SINK-related logic found in compiled .js files\n2. The assertion error appears to be runtime-related rather than build-time\n3. The search across all file types didn't reveal additional SINK logic hidden in non-TypeScript files\n4. No evidence of the SINK logic being transformed or affected by build steps\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - investigation was exploratory and did not require changes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Comprehensive search across multiple file types didn't reveal hidden SINK logic\n2. Build configuration examination showed no special handling of SINK-related code\n3. The error message suggests a runtime assertion rather than a build-time issue\n4. The original hypothesis about compiled JS files containing the crucial logic appears incorrect\n\nThe investigation suggests that the SINK node logic is indeed in the TypeScript files, and the issue is more likely related to the runtime behavior of the block_finalize function mentioned in the context, rather than being hidden in compiled or alternative file types."
