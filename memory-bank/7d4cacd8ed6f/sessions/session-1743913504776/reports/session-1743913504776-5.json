"HYPOTHESIS: The `AssertionError: doesn't end with SINK` originates from a dependency listed in `package.json`, not directly from the `deebo-prototype` source code. The terms `SINK` and `block_finalize` exist within that dependency's codebase.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\nI searched through both the main codebase and the node_modules directory for occurrences of \"SINK\" and \"block_finalize\". The findings show that:\n\n1. The error message appears to be from the main codebase, specifically in the IR (Intermediate Representation) handling code\n2. Found \"SINK\" and \"block_finalize\" references in src/ir/block.ts and other source files\n3. Did not find relevant occurrences of these terms in node_modules\n4. The implementation is part of the core IR block finalization logic in deebo-prototype\n\nKey findings:\n- The error is coming from block finalization logic that expects blocks to end with a SINK operation\n- This is part of the compiler's IR validation, not from a dependency\n- The implementation is in the project's own source code, particularly in the IR handling layer\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - investigation only focused on locating source of error\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence clearly shows this is not a dependency issue but rather core compiler logic in the main codebase. The terms are specifically used in the IR block handling code, and the assertion is part of the compiler's own validation logic. The complete absence of these specific terms in dependencies, combined with their clear presence and usage in the source code, provides strong evidence against the hypothesis."
