Running the failing test `test_avg_pool3d_failure` to capture the UOp list output just before the `pm_block_finalize` rewrite. This will help analyze the block structure and SINK placement, potentially validating the scenario agent's hypothesis about nested loop handling."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T05:52:16.206Z","observation":"Applied a potential fix to `block_finalize` in `tinygrad/codegen/linearize.py`. This version finds and removes the SINK UOp instead of asserting it's the last element after combining with block sources. Running `test_avg_pool3d_failure` to verify."}

{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T06:47:43.710Z","observation":"The attempt to fix the SINK issue by relaxing the context check in `block_merge` (using `issubset`) was insufficient. The test `test_avg_pool3d_failure` still fails with `AssertionError: doesn't end with SINK`. The root cause likely involves other aspects of block merging or ordering for complex reduction graphs."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T06:48:46.330Z","observation":"Scenario reports indicate multiple contributing factors to the SINK disconnection in `linearize_uop` for 3D pooling:\n- Scenario 0 confirmed strict context comparison in `block_merge` is problematic.\n- Scenario 1 confirmed initial SINK block creation with empty context in `make_basic_blocks` is problematic.\n- Scenario 2 suggested issues with merging parallel execution paths from the complex graph.\n- Scenario 3 is still investigating potential topological ordering issues during merges.\nThe core problem seems to be a combination of how contexts are calculated, propagated, and compared during the block creation and merging phases for complex reduction graphs."}
