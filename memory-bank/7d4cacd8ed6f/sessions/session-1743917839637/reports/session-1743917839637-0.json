"HYPOTHESIS: The config refactor may have introduced a mismatch between the new configuration structure and how it's being accessed in the code.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the codebase for configuration-related files and usage patterns\n- Searched for type definitions and interfaces related to configuration\n- Attempted to verify TypeScript compilation errors\n- Checked build process and recent commit history\n\nKey findings:\n1. The repository structure shows evidence of configuration files\n2. There appears to be some TypeScript type definitions for configuration\n3. Multiple files are accessing configuration objects\n\nHowever, without complete responses from all commands, I have limited visibility into:\n- The exact nature of the config refactor changes\n- Current TypeScript errors\n- The full extent of configuration usage across the codebase\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as further investigation is needed to confidently identify the specific mismatches.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\nReasoning:\n1. Limited visibility into the actual configuration changes made during the refactor\n2. Incomplete information about current TypeScript errors\n3. Unable to fully trace the configuration object structure and its usage patterns\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Examine the specific commits that implemented the config refactor\n2. Review TypeScript type definitions before and after the refactor\n3. Create a comprehensive map of configuration access patterns in the codebase"
