"HYPOTHESIS: The error is occurring because the LLM provider configuration has been refactored to support multiple providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenRouter) but there's a mismatch in how the API keys and endpoints are being accessed.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe investigation revealed several key aspects:\n\n1. Package.json confirms the addition of new dependencies including \"@google/generative-ai\"\n2. The codebase shows a transition to multi-provider support, particularly in the configuration structure\n3. Search results reveal multiple references to provider configurations and API keys across different files\n4. The error appears to be more complex than just API endpoint and authentication mismatches\n\nKey findings:\n1. The search results reveal significant refactoring for multi-provider support, but we did not find direct evidence of mismatched API endpoints or authentication structures\n2. The configuration changes exist but don't show clear signs of structural problems in how API keys and endpoints are accessed\n3. Mother-agent.ts and scenario-agent.ts show evidence of the transition to multi-provider support, but the immediate error doesn't appear to be directly related to provider configuration mismatches\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis rather than fixing the issue.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nReasons for medium confidence:\n1. While we found evidence of the multi-provider refactoring, we couldn't definitively link the current error to configuration mismatches\n2. The configuration structure appears to be properly set up for multiple providers\n3. The error might be related to how the providers are being initialized or used, rather than the configuration structure itself\n4. Without the specific error message or stack trace, we can't fully validate that the configuration structure is the root cause\n\nRecommendation for further investigation:\n- Examine the actual error messages and stack traces\n- Look into provider initialization code\n- Check the runtime configuration loading process"
