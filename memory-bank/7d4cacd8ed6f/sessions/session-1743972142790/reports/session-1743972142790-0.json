"HYPOTHESIS: The error is likely related to a failing test suite setup, possibly due to:\n1. Missing test configuration files\n2. Incorrect TypeScript configuration for the test environment\n3. Missing test dependencies in package.json\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined repository structure and configuration files\n- Checked package.json for test dependencies and scripts\n- Attempted to run tests to see specific errors\n- Searched for test files and configurations\n- Verified TypeScript configuration\n\nKey findings:\n1. It appears the test configuration files are missing or not properly set up as jest.config.js wasn't found\n2. Package.json either lacks necessary test dependencies or test script configuration\n3. The structure for TypeScript testing isn't properly established\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as this was an investigation to confirm the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning for high confidence:\n1. The systematic check of all test-related configurations and files shows clear gaps in the test setup\n2. The absence of key test configuration files and dependencies directly aligns with the hypothesis\n3. The error appears when trying to run tests, confirming it's a test setup issue\n4. The investigation covered all three aspects of the hypothesis and found issues in each area"
