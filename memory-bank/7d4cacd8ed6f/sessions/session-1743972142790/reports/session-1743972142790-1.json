"HYPOTHESIS: The test error is occurring because of a missing or incomplete test environment setup, specifically:\n1. The repository lacks proper test configuration (no jest.config.js or similar found)\n2. The package.json shows recent changes but insufficient test-related dependencies\n3. The project appears to be in transition with multiple file changes, including package.json and tool configurations\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined:\n1. Project structure and configuration files\n2. Package.json for test-related dependencies\n3. Presence of test files and configuration\n4. Recent repository changes\n\nKey findings:\n1. The repository seems to be newly initialized or minimally configured, as evidenced by the absence of many standard files\n2. Package.json either doesn't exist or isn't accessible (received error when trying to read it)\n3. No test configuration files (jest.config.js or similar) were found\n4. No test files (*.test.ts or *.spec.ts) were found in the repository\n\nWhile this partially confirms our hypothesis about missing test configuration, we can't fully validate parts 2 and 3 of the hypothesis because we couldn't access package.json to verify the dependencies and recent changes.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on confirming the hypothesis rather than fixing the issue.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nThe confidence level is medium because:\n- We clearly confirmed the absence of test configuration and test files\n- However, we couldn't verify the package.json-related aspects of the hypothesis due to access issues\n- The error message itself wasn't specific enough to definitively tie it to the missing test setup\n- There might be other factors contributing to the test error that aren't visible from just the configuration perspective\n\nAdditional investigation would be needed to:\n1. Verify the actual package.json contents and dependencies\n2. Determine if there are any test-related scripts or commands being attempted\n3. Get the specific test error message to better understand the root cause"
