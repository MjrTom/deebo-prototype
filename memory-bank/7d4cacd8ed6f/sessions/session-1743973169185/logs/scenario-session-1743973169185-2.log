How observations are stored and queued\n2. The timing of observation checks relative to LLM calls\n3. Any existing queue management or buffering mechanisms\n\nKey findings:\n1. There doesn't appear to be a proper queuing mechanism - observations are written to mother.log but there's no guarantee of ordered processing\n2. The check-before-LLM-call approach means observations can be missed during long processing periods\n3. There's no mechanism to ensure all observations are eventually processed - they rely entirely on timing of LLM calls\n\nThe hypothesis is partially confirmed because:\n- The issue isn't necessarily queue overload (as there isn't really a queue)\n- The real issue appears to be the timing-dependent nature of observation processing\n- During heavy load, the gaps between LLM calls grow larger, making it more likely for observations to be missed\n- Without a proper queue, observations can be effectively lost if not processed during the next available check\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made as this was an investigative session, but recommended changes would include:\n1. Implementing a proper observation queue with guaranteed processing\n2. Adding timestamps to observations to ensure chronological processing\n3. Adding a mechanism to track unprocessed observations\n4. Consider implementing an active notification system rather than relying on polling\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code analysis clearly shows the timing-dependent nature of observation processing\n2. The lack of a proper queuing mechanism explains why observations can be missed\n3. The behavior matches exactly what we'd expect from this architecture under load\n4. The issue isn't about overload but rather about the fundamental design of the observation checking mechanism\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
