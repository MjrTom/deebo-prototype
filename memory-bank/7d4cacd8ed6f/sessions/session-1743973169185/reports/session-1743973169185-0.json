"HYPOTHESIS: Race Condition Hypothesis: The observation processing is suffering from a race condition during high load. When multiple scenario agents are running simultaneously:\n1. Observations are being written to mother.log\n2. But the file read/check timing between agents causes some observations to be missed\n3. Each agent might be reading the file at different times, getting different snapshots\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Searched for all code related to mother.log file operations\n- Examined observation processing implementation\n- Looked for any existing file locking or synchronization mechanisms\n- Analyzed file read/write patterns\n\nKey findings:\n1. No file locking mechanism exists for mother.log\n2. Multiple agents can read the file simultaneously\n3. File reads are not atomic operations\n4. No synchronization between writes and reads\n5. No mechanism to ensure all agents see all observations\n\nThe investigation confirms the race condition hypothesis because:\n- Multiple agents reading simultaneously can get different snapshots of the file\n- No synchronization means an agent could read while another is writing\n- Without atomic operations or proper locking, observations can be missed\n- The issue manifests under load because more concurrent operations increase the chance of race conditions\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet - this was an investigative session to confirm the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning:\n1. The code clearly shows no protection against concurrent access\n2. The behavior matches classic race condition symptoms:\n   - Works in small tests (less concurrent access)\n   - Fails under load (more opportunities for race conditions)\n   - Inconsistent/non-deterministic behavior\n3. The implementation matches the theoretical model of a race condition:\n   - Shared resource (mother.log)\n   - Multiple concurrent readers\n   - No synchronization mechanism\n4. The symptoms exactly match what we'd expect from file read/write race conditions\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Implement file locking mechanism\n2. Consider using a proper message queue instead of file-based communication\n3. Add atomic read/write operations\n4. Implement a synchronization mechanism between writers and readers"
