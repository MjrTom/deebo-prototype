"HYPOTHESIS: File System Buffer Hypothesis: During intensive runs, there might be file system buffering issues:\n1. The add_observation writes are being buffered and not immediately flushed to disk\n2. Agents checking for observations may read before the buffer is flushed\n3. This would be more apparent under heavy load when there's more file I/O happening\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the observation mechanism implementation focusing on:\n1. How observations are written to mother.log\n2. How observations are read by agents\n3. The file system operations used\n\nKey findings:\n1. The code uses synchronous file operations (writeFileSync/readFileSync) throughout the observation system\n2. Synchronous operations bypass Node.js's internal buffering - they complete fully before returning\n3. writeFileSync guarantees the data is written to the disk before continuing\n4. The OS may still buffer at the filesystem level, but this would affect both reading and writing equally\n5. Since readFileSync is used to check observations, it will see any completed writeFileSync operations\n\nThe hypothesis is unlikely because:\n1. Synchronous file operations don't have the buffering behavior described in the hypothesis\n2. If OS-level buffering was the issue, we'd see inconsistent results even in small test runs\n3. The issue correlating with heavy load suggests a timing/scheduling problem rather than a buffering one\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the hypothesis was disproven.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning:\n1. The use of synchronous file operations fundamentally contradicts the buffering hypothesis\n2. Node.js documentation explicitly states that writeFileSync ensures data is written to disk\n3. The symptom pattern (working in small tests, failing under load) doesn't match what we'd expect from buffering issues\n4. The verified success in small test runs using the exact same file operations further disproves buffering as the cause\n\nAlternative Direction:\nThe real issue likely relates to timing between agent LLM calls. Since observations are only checked before LLM calls, and intensive runs might have longer gaps between calls, this could explain why observations appear missed. Consider investigating:\n1. The timing between LLM calls during intensive runs\n2. Adding a separate observation polling mechanism not tied to LLM calls\n3. Implementing an event-based notification system for new observations"
