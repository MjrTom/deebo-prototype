"HYPOTHESIS: Processing Lifecycle Hypothesis: The observation processing issue stems from a mismatch between how observations are meant to be processed according to the rules/design and how they're actually being handled.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the observation processing system implementation\n- Found that observations are indeed checked before LLM calls but lack formal tracking\n- Key findings:\n1. No persistent tracking of which observations have been processed\n2. Observations are checked on a timing basis without guarantees\n3. No acknowledgment system exists\n4. Multiple agents can potentially process the same observation\n5. During intensive runs, the time between LLM calls can cause observations to be missed\n\nThe code analysis reveals that the current implementation:\n- Writes observations to mother.log\n- Checks for new observations before LLM calls\n- Does not maintain state about which observations have been processed\n- Has no mechanism to ensure ordered processing\n- Lacks acknowledgment tracking\n\nThis directly confirms the hypothesis by showing that all four hypothesized issues exist:\n1. ✓ Observations aren't guaranteed to be processed in order\n2. ✓ No acknowledgment tracking exists\n3. ✓ Timing-based checks can miss observations during intensive runs\n4. ✓ No formal lifecycle exists for observation states\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n\nThe high confidence comes from:\n1. Clear evidence in the code showing lack of tracking mechanisms\n2. Direct correlation between the hypothesis points and actual implementation gaps\n3. The behavior matches exactly what we'd expect with this architecture during high load\n4. The timing-dependent nature of the current implementation explains why it works in small tests but fails under load\n\nRecommended Next Steps:\n1. Implement an observation state tracking system\n2. Add unique IDs to observations\n3. Create an acknowledgment mechanism\n4. Implement a proper observation lifecycle state machine\n5. Consider adding a dedicated observation queue per agent"
