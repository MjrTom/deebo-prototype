The Node.js EventEmitter has a default maximum listener limit of 10\n2. When this limit is exceeded, Node.js will print a warning but continue - however, new listeners may be ignored\n3. The fact that this only occurs during large debugging sessions with ~10 agents strongly correlates with this limit\n4. The systematic nature of the failure (complete loss of observations rather than partial) matches the behavior of hitting the EventEmitter limit\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n- There is indeed a queue/buffer limit, though it's at the EventEmitter listener level rather than a message queue\n- This limit is being hit specifically during intensive sessions with many agents\n- The behavior matches exactly what we're seeing - messages being emitted but not received\n- The default limit of 10 perfectly explains why it happens with ~10 agents\n\nCHANGES NEEDED:\n1. Need to increase the maxListeners limit using setMaxListeners() on the EventEmitter instance handling observations\n2. Consider implementing a queueing system for very large agent counts\n3. Add monitoring for EventEmitter warnings\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence strongly supports this conclusion:\n- The timing (10+ agents) matches exactly with Node's default limit\n- The behavior (complete message loss) matches EventEmitter limit behavior\n- This explains why it works in small tests but fails in larger sessions\n- The systematic nature of the failure matches a hard limit being hit rather than a sporadic issue\n\nThis is a classic case of hitting Node.js's built-in safety limits during scale-up, which matches all observed behavior and provides a clear path to resolution.\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
