Looking at observations.ts, I can see how the observation system works:\n\n1. It uses fs/promises for file operations (writeFile, readFile)\n2. Each agent writes to its own log file: `${agentId}.log`\n3. The system uses append mode ('a' flag) for writes\n4. Reads are done using readFile with utf8 encoding\n\nThis implementation could definitely lead to file lock contention issues when multiple agents are running. Here's why:\n\n1. Node.js's fs/promises doesn't handle file lock conflicts well - failed reads due to locks often result in silent failures (caught in the try/catch block)\n2. Each agent is constantly trying to read observations while others are writing\n3.

Looking at observations.ts, I can see how the observation system works:\n\n1. It uses fs/promises for file operations (writeFile, readFile)\n2. Each agent writes to its own log file: `${agentId}.log`\n3. The system uses append mode ('a' flag) for writes\n4. Reads are done using readFile with utf8 encoding\n\nThis implementation could definitely lead to file lock contention issues when multiple agents are running. Here's why:\n\n1. Node.js's fs/promises doesn't handle file lock conflicts well - failed reads due to locks often result in silent failures (caught in the try/catch block)\n2. Each agent is constantly trying to read observations while others are writing\n3.

Looking at observations.ts, I can see how the observation system works:\n\n1. It uses fs/promises for file operations (writeFile, readFile)\n2. Each agent writes to its own log file: `${agentId}.log`\n3. The system uses append mode ('a' flag) for writes\n4. Reads are done using readFile with utf8 encoding\n\nThis implementation could definitely lead to file lock contention issues when multiple agents are running. Here's why:\n\n1. Node.js's fs/promises doesn't handle file lock conflicts well - failed reads due to locks often result in silent failures (caught in the try/catch block)\n2.

I can see several critical issues that would cause observation misses under heavy load:\n\n1. Silent Failure: The catch block in `getAgentObservations` just returns an empty array when any error occurs - including file lock errors. This means agents silently miss observations when read access fails.\n\n2. No Retry Logic: When a read fails due to file lock, there's no retry attempt. The agent just moves on with an empty array.\n\n3. Synchronous File Operations: Even though fs/promises is used, each read/write is a one-shot operation. There's no coordination between multiple agents trying to access the same files.\n\n4. Write-then-Read Pattern: Each observation is written and then needs to be read by other agents.

Looking at observations.ts, I can see how the observation system works:\n\n1. It uses fs/promises for file operations (writeFile, readFile)\n2.

Reads are done using readFile with utf8 encoding\n\nThis implementation could definitely lead to file lock contention issues when multiple agents are running. Here's why:\n\n1. Node.js's fs/promises doesn't handle file lock conflicts well - failed reads due to locks often result in silent failures (caught in the try/catch block)\n2.

I can see several critical issues that would cause observation misses under heavy load:\n\n1. Silent Failure: The catch block in `getAgentObservations` just returns an empty array when any error occurs - including file lock errors. This means agents silently miss observations when read access fails.\n\n2. No Retry Logic: When a read fails due to file lock, there's no retry attempt. The agent just moves on with an empty array.\n\n3. Synchronous File Operations: Even though fs/promises is used, each read/write is a one-shot operation. There's no coordination between multiple agents trying to access the same files.\n\n4. Write-then-Read Pattern: Each observation is written and then needs to be read by other agents.
