The pattern matches exactly:\n\n1. Mother agent: Uses absolute paths when writing observations (/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank)\n2. Scenario agents: Use project-relative paths (like ../memory-bank or [project]/memory-bank)\n3. During local testing: Both paths resolve to the same location (explains why small tests work)\n4. During external debugging: Paths diverge - mother writes to deebo-prototype but agents look in external project\n\nThis explains ALL observed behaviors:\n- Why writes succeed (absolute path always works)\n- Why reads fail completely (wrong path)\n- Why it only happens with external projects\n- Why local tests work fine\n\nThe confidence is high because this isn't just a theory - the code structure and path handling patterns directly demonstrate this behavior.\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
