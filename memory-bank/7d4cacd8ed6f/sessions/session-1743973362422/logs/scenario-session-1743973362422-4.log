DEEBO_ROOT Resolution:\n- The code confirms that DEEBO_ROOT is indeed defined using `join(__dirname, '..')` in index.ts\n- This means the path is relative to the executing script's location\n\n2. Process Context:\n- Mother agent executes from the deebo-prototype directory context\n- Scenario agents are spawned while working in the external project directory (e.g., tinygrad)\n- Each process resolves __dirname independently based on its execution context\n\n3. Critical Path Resolution Issue:\n- When mother agent writes observations: Resolves DEEBO_ROOT from deebo-prototype/src → correct path\n- When scenario agents read observations: Resolves DEEBO_ROOT from external-project/src → incorrect path\n- This explains why observations are written successfully but never found by scenario agents\n\n4. Scale Impact:\n- Explains why it works in small test runs (where paths might accidentally align)\n- But fails consistently in large sessions (like tinygrad debugging) where agents are running in the external project context\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was a validation task. However, the fix would require:\n1. Making DEEBO_ROOT an absolute path at initialization time\n2. Passing this absolute path to scenario agents during spawn\n3. Using environment variables to ensure path consistency across processes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure directly confirms the hypothesis\n2. The behavior perfectly matches the reported symptoms\n3. The path resolution mechanism in Node.js is well-documented and behaves exactly as described\n4. This explains both why observations are written but not found, and why it only happens in large external project runs\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
