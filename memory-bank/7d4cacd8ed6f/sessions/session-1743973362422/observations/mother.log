{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:03:08.879Z","observation":"Important distinction: During the tinygrad debugging, observations weren't just delayed or processed out of order - they weren't being picked up by the agents at all. This suggests a more fundamental issue with observation detection/reading during high load, rather than just timing or ordering problems. Focus on why agents might completely fail to detect new observations while still being able to write them."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:03:22.787Z","observation":"Consider the path handling: When debugging tinygrad, we were in a different codebase but deebo's memory-bank is always in the deebo-prototype directory. Could there be an issue where agents are looking for observations in the wrong location during external project debugging? This might explain why observations are written successfully (correct path) but not picked up (wrong path)."}
