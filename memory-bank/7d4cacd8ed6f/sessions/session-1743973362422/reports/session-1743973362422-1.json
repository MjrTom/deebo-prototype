"HYPOTHESIS: File Lock Contention: With ~10 agents all trying to read observation files simultaneously, file system locks could be causing read attempts to fail silently, especially if the observation system uses file-based IPC\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined observation system implementation in observations.ts\n- Analyzed error handling and file access patterns\n- Traced observation usage in scenario agents\n- Found multiple compounding issues that would cause observation misses under load\n\nKey findings:\n1. Silent failures: Read errors (including lock conflicts) return empty array\n2. High-frequency reads: Each agent checks before every LLM call\n3. No retry mechanism: Failed reads are immediately abandoned\n4. Write-while-reading conflicts: Mother writes while agents read\n5. Inefficient file handling: New file operations for each check\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This investigation was to confirm the hypothesis, not implement fixes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nExplanation: The code clearly shows a file-based IPC system with no concurrency controls, combined with silent failure handling. This matches perfectly with the observed behavior: observations being written successfully but not picked up by agents during high-load situations. The system works in small tests because file lock conflicts are less likely with fewer agents.\n\nRecommended fixes would include:\n1. Add retry mechanism for failed reads\n2. Implement proper file locking\n3. Consider switching to a more robust IPC mechanism\n4. At minimum, log file access failures instead of silently ignoring them"
