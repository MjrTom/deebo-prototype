"HYPOTHESIS: Process Resource Limits: During intensive debugging with many agents, we might be hitting process limits (like max open file descriptors) that prevent agents from opening/reading new observation files, while writing still succeeds\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed system file descriptor limits and current usage\n- Searched for file operation patterns in the codebase\n- Examined error handling around file operations\n- Considered the asymmetric behavior (writes succeed, reads fail)\n\nKey findings:\n1. File descriptor limits exist at OS level and can affect Node.js processes\n2. Write operations often succeed even when at descriptor limits because they're brief\n3. Read operations for observations might be keeping files open longer\n4. With 10 agents all trying to read observations continuously, we could easily hit limits\n5. The fact that small test runs work fine but large runs fail supports this hypothesis\n\nThe specific failure pattern (writes succeeding but reads failing) is consistent with hitting file descriptor limits because:\n- Write operations typically need descriptors briefly\n- Read operations in monitoring scenarios often keep descriptors open longer\n- When limits are hit, new open attempts fail while existing operations continue\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes yet, but recommended solutions:\n1. Implement file descriptor pooling\n2. Add proper cleanup of file handles\n3. Monitor and log file descriptor usage\n4. Implement retry mechanism with backoff for read operations\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The symptoms perfectly match file descriptor exhaustion\n- The scale dependence (works small, fails large) is characteristic\n- The asymmetric behavior between reads/writes is a classic indicator\n- The fact that this only happens during intensive debugging with many agents aligns with resource limit theory"
