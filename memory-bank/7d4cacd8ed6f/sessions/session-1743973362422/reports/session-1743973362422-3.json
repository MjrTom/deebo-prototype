"HYPOTHESIS: Path Resolution Mismatch Hypothesis: When debugging external projects (like tinygrad), there's a critical path resolution issue where mother agent writes to deebo-prototype/memory-bank but scenario agents read from external-project/memory-bank.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined code patterns around memory-bank access, path resolution, and external project handling\n- Found evidence that path resolution differs between mother agent and scenario agents\n- Key findings show that:\n  1. Memory bank operations are tightly coupled with project path resolution\n  2. External project handling has inconsistent path resolution logic\n  3. The code structure confirms the hypothesis - mother agent uses absolute paths while scenario agents use project-relative paths\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - this was a validation investigation\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe search results and directory structure strongly support the hypothesis. The pattern matches exactly:\n\n1. Mother agent: Uses absolute paths when writing observations (/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank)\n2. Scenario agents: Use project-relative paths (like ../memory-bank or [project]/memory-bank)\n3. During local testing: Both paths resolve to the same location (explains why small tests work)\n4. During external debugging: Paths diverge - mother writes to deebo-prototype but agents look in external project\n\nThis explains ALL observed behaviors:\n- Why writes succeed (absolute path always works)\n- Why reads fail completely (wrong path)\n- Why it only happens with external projects\n- Why local tests work fine\n\nThe confidence is high because this isn't just a theory - the code structure and path handling patterns directly demonstrate this behavior."
