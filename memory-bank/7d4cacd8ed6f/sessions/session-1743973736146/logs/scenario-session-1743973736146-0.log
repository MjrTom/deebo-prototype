While the add_observation function returns success after enqueueing the write operation, the actual disk writes may be failing or getting dropped due to:\n1.

Buffer flushing issues under high concurrency\"\nYour job is to either validate the hypothesis, falsify it, or propose alternative directions if stuck. You do not need to fix the entire bug — your focus is the truth of the SPECIFIC hypothesis you are assigned to.\nThat being said, don't be too hasty to report a conclusion. If you see something potentially useful/interesting, investigate it further. Debugging is a complicated, nonlinear process, and subtle clues could be useful.\nIMPORTANT:\n- READ THE CONTEXT CAREFULLY: \"Key points about the actual issue:\n\n1. add_observation tool returns success ('Observation logged')\n2. But observations are not actually present in the log files\n3. This happened during intensive tinygrad debugging with ~10 scenario agents\n4. The observation system works in small test runs (like our recent tests in deebo-prototype)\n\nPrevious investigation went off track by assuming the observations were being written but not read. The actual issue is that they're not being written at all, despite the success message.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not attempt to read any log files directly - they are too large and will cause crashes.\"\n- This contains what approaches have failed and why\n- Don't waste time repeating failed attempts\n- These are instructions, not suggestions.

The observation system appears to use asynchronous writes but may not properly await their completion\n2. Error handling appears insufficient - errors in the write pipeline might not propagate back to the caller\n3. Success messages are being returned before write operations are confirmed complete\n4. No explicit queue management or buffer overflow protection was found\n\nThis partially confirms the hypothesis because:\n- The immediate success return without write confirmation supports point #2 (queue overflow)\n- The lack of proper error propagation could explain why failures are silent\n- However, we found no evidence of file handle exhaustion (point #1)\n- The buffer flushing issues (point #3) remain possible but unconfirmed\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made - investigation focused on code analysis\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nReasoning:\n- Clear evidence of premature success reporting\n- Found architectural issues that could cause the observed behavior\n- However, without being able to directly reproduce the issue or examine logs, we cannot be 100% certain\n- Would need instrumentation of the write pipeline to fully confirm the exact failure point\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Add write confirmation tracking\n2. Implement proper error propagation\n3. Add a bounded queue with backpressure\n4. Include detailed logging of write operations separate from the observation system\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
