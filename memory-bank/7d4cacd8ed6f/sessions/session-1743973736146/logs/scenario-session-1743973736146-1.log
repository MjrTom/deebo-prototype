Under high load, write buffers aren't being flushed fast enough leading to lost writes\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Searched through codebase for file write operations and observation handling\n- Looked specifically for async/await patterns and error handling\n- Analyzed the implementation of add_observation and related code\n\nKey findings:\n- The code appears to be missing the basic write operation implementation entirely or it's located in a different location\n- The regular write operation patterns I expected to find (fs.writeFile, fs.appendFile) are not evident in the main code paths\n- This suggests the issue may be more fundamental than a race condition - the writes might not be happening at all\n\nThis refutes the hypothesis because:\n1. The hypothesis assumed the write operations were happening but not being properly synchronized\n2. The evidence suggests the write operations themselves may be missing or misconfigured\n3. A race condition implies concurrent operations, but we can't find the basic write operations that would be racing\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The systematic code search didn't reveal the expected file operation patterns\n- If this were a race condition, we would at least see the underlying write operations\n- The complete absence of expected file operations suggests a more fundamental implementation issue\n- This matches the observed behavior (success message but no actual writes) better than a race condition\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nInvestigate whether:\n1. The observation write implementation is in an unexpected location\n2. The write operations are being swallowed/ignored by middleware\n3.
