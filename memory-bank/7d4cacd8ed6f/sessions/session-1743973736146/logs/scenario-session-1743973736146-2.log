You do not need to fix the entire bug — your focus is the truth of the SPECIFIC hypothesis you are assigned to.\nThat being said, don't be too hasty to report a conclusion. If you see something potentially useful/interesting, investigate it further. Debugging is a complicated, nonlinear process, and subtle clues could be useful.\nIMPORTANT:\n- READ THE CONTEXT CAREFULLY: \"Key points about the actual issue:\n\n1. add_observation tool returns success ('Observation logged')\n2. But observations are not actually present in the log files\n3. This happened during intensive tinygrad debugging with ~10 scenario agents\n4. The observation system works in small test runs (like our recent tests in deebo-prototype)\n\nPrevious investigation went off track by assuming the observations were being written but not read. The actual issue is that they're not being written at all, despite the success message.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not attempt to read any log files directly - they are too large and will cause crashes.\"\n- This contains what approaches have failed and why\n- Don't waste time repeating failed attempts\n- These are instructions, not suggestions.
