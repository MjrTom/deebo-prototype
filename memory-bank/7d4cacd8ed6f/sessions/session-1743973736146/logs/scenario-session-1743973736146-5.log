Here's why:\n\n<report>\nHYPOTHESIS: The observation write failure stems from DEEBO_ROOT path resolution issues between deebo-prototype and external projects.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n1. Examined DEEBO_ROOT initialization and usage:\n   - DEEBO_ROOT is resolved absolutely using process.cwd() in index.ts\n   - This makes it independent of where the code is run from\n   - The path is always absolute, not relative\n\n2. Checked writeObservation implementation:\n   - The function uses mkdirSync with { recursive: true }\n   - This ensures directories are created if they don't exist\n   - The function would throw an error if path resolution failed\n   - Success message only comes after actual write attempt\n\n3. Key findings:\n   - Path resolution isn't the issue because:\n     a) Absolute paths are used\n     b) Directory creation is handled\n     c) Write errors would be caught\n   - The issue appears during concurrent writes (10 agents)\n   - Success messages only appear after write attempts\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - hypothesis disproven\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. Found concrete evidence that paths are handled correctly\n2. Success messages come after write attempts, not before\n3. The original issue manifests under high concurrency (10 agents)\n4. The code would throw errors on path resolution failures\n\nThe real issue likely relates to concurrent writes or file system limitations under high load, not path resolution. The hypothesis doesn't explain why writes fail silently while reporting success.\n</report>\n\nI suggest investigating concurrent write handling or file system limits as alternative hypotheses, as these better match the symptoms (failures under high load with 10 agents)."},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype"}}
