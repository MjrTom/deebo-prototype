{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:09:55.681Z","observation":"Important clarification: The agents themselves aren't writing observations - only the user/Cline is using the add_observation tool. So this isn't about concurrent writes from agents, but about why observations from the add_observation tool aren't actually being written despite the success message."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:10:11.724Z","observation":"The issue can't be about concurrent writes or file system load because there's only one writer (Cline/user) using add_observation. We need to investigate why the add_observation tool itself isn't actually writing to disk despite returning success. The number of scenario agents might be relevant but not because of write contention - they're only reading, not writing observations."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:11:47.231Z","observation":"Critical insight: The add_observation implementation CANNOT be incomplete or broken because observations are working perfectly in our current debug session. The issue must be something specific to intensive external project debugging (like tinygrad) that causes it to fail, while working fine in deebo-prototype tests."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:17:29.398Z","observation":"Important correction: There is NO concurrency issue because: 1) Only Cline writes observations, not the agents 2) Each agent has its own log file. The issue must be something else causing observations to not be written despite success messages."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:19:07.416Z","observation":"Critical insight: The error handling in add_observation is backwards - it returns a success message even when there's an error! The error message is constructed but never shown to the user. This explains why we always see 'Observation logged' even when the write fails."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-06T21:22:48.350Z","observation":"CRITICAL: We have enough evidence to write a solution. The error handling in add_observation is backwards - it formats errors as successes. We need to fix this by either using the MCP error field or properly throwing errors. Make a decision and write the solution."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-07T00:47:34.966Z","observation":"Key insight: We should not try to redesign tinygrad's block context system. The issue is specifically about SINK nodes disappearing during pool3d linearization. The debug logs show SINK nodes exist at entry but vanish during merging. Focus on preserving existing SINK nodes through the merge process rather than changing how contexts work."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-07T00:48:32.733Z","observation":"Looking at the debug logs and current file state, we've gone too far with architectural changes. The file shows complex changes like preventing block merges with SINKs, adding special handling, and new helper functions. But the original issue was simple - SINKs disappear during merging. Our original fix to restore/wrap SINKs before finalization was correct. We just need to find the exact point where they vanish, not redesign the whole system."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-07T00:48:43.628Z","observation":"Looking at the current file, we've added too much complexity trying to prevent SINK nodes from being merged at all. This is over-engineering. The original issue was just that SINKs vanish during merging, and our original fix to restore/wrap them before finalization was correct. Let's revert these complex changes and instead focus on finding exactly where in the merge process the SINKs are getting dropped."}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-07T00:50:17.900Z","observation":"STOP. We're going too far with changes to linearize.py. We need to: 1) Keep original file structure intact 2) Add minimal debug prints at key points only 3) Focus on finding where SINKs vanish, not rewriting the system. Let's revert and start over with a focused approach."}
