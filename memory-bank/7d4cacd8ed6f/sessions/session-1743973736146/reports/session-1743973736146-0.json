"HYPOTHESIS: The observation logging system is experiencing a race condition or resource contention issue when multiple scenario agents (~10) try to write observations simultaneously. While the add_observation function returns success after enqueueing the write operation, the actual disk writes may be failing or getting dropped due to:\n1. File handle exhaustion from too many concurrent writes\n2. Write queue overflow causing silent drops\n3. Buffer flushing issues under high concurrency\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the codebase for observation logging implementation\n- Searched for queue/buffer mechanisms and file system operations\n- Analyzed error handling and resource management\n- Checked system-level file handle usage\n\nKey findings:\n1. The observation system appears to use asynchronous writes but may not properly await their completion\n2. Error handling appears insufficient - errors in the write pipeline might not propagate back to the caller\n3. Success messages are being returned before write operations are confirmed complete\n4. No explicit queue management or buffer overflow protection was found\n\nThis partially confirms the hypothesis because:\n- The immediate success return without write confirmation supports point #2 (queue overflow)\n- The lack of proper error propagation could explain why failures are silent\n- However, we found no evidence of file handle exhaustion (point #1)\n- The buffer flushing issues (point #3) remain possible but unconfirmed\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made - investigation focused on code analysis\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nReasoning:\n- Clear evidence of premature success reporting\n- Found architectural issues that could cause the observed behavior\n- However, without being able to directly reproduce the issue or examine logs, we cannot be 100% certain\n- Would need instrumentation of the write pipeline to fully confirm the exact failure point\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Add write confirmation tracking\n2. Implement proper error propagation\n3. Add a bounded queue with backpressure\n4. Include detailed logging of write operations separate from the observation system"
