"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failures stem from Node.js event loop/callback queue saturation during high-concurrency scenarios\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the code implementation thoroughly\n- Added timing instrumentation to track write operations\n- Analyzed error handling and async flow\n\nKey findings:\n1. The code is properly using async/await with fs.promises\n2. File operations are being properly awaited\n3. Error handling is in place with try/catch blocks\n4. The event loop saturation theory doesn't hold because:\n   - Node.js fs.promises guarantees that callbacks won't be dropped\n   - await ensures we wait for writes to complete\n   - Success can't be reported before write completes due to await\n   - Error handling would catch and report failures\n\nThe hypothesis is likely incorrect because:\n- Node.js event loop design prevents callback dropping\n- async/await ensures proper sequencing\n- File operations are queued and handled reliably\n- Errors would be caught and reported rather than silently failing\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added timing instrumentation to add_observation.ts:\n   - Measures total operation time\n   - Ensures proper error propagation\n2. Added detailed timing to observation.ts:\n   - Tracks individual write durations\n   - Logs warnings for slow operations\n   - Improved error reporting\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. Node.js's event loop design specifically prevents the hypothesized failure mode\n2. The async/await pattern ensures operations complete before success is reported\n3. If writes were failing due to queue saturation, we would see errors propagated\n4. The instrumentation added will help identify the actual cause (likely filesystem permissions, disk issues, or path problems)\n\nAlternative directions to investigate:\n1. File system permissions and quotas\n2. Disk I/O bottlenecks\n3. Path resolution issues\n4. File handle limits"
