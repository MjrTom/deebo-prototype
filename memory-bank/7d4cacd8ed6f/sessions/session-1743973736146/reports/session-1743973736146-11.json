"HYPOTHESIS: Original hypothesis about project path mismatches was incorrect.\n\nCONFIRMED: No (but found actual cause)\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined:\n1. add_observation implementation in index.ts\n2. writeObservation implementation in observations.ts\n3. The full observation flow\n\nKey findings:\n1. The issue isn't about path resolution between projects as hypothesized\n2. The actual problem is in session management during concurrent access:\n   - add_observation tries to find the \"most recent session\" by sorting sessions\n   - Under high load (~10 agents), this creates a race condition\n   - Different agents can get different \"most recent\" sessions\n   - Observations get written to wrong/different sessions\n\nThis explains all symptoms better than original hypothesis:\n- Success messages: Directory operations succeed technically\n- Missing observations: They exist but in wrong sessions\n- Works in small tests: Less concurrent session confusion\n- Fails under load: More agents = more session conflicts\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This was an investigation task only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. Found actual code paths contradicting original hypothesis\n2. New explanation matches all symptoms\n3. Race condition is a known pattern that explains concurrent failures\n4. Code structure in add_observation shows clear potential for session confusion\n5. This matches the \"works in small tests, fails under load\" pattern perfectly\n\nSUGGESTION:\nWhile not part of this investigation, the fix would likely involve:\n1. Either passing sessionId directly to add_observation\n2. Or implementing proper session tracking per agent\n3. Adding proper concurrent session management"
