"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failures stem from a missing or incorrect repoPath in the add_observation tool chain\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe code review revealed several important findings that contradict the original hypothesis:\n\n1. The add_observation tool doesn't actually require repoPath for writing observations. The observations are stored in the memory-bank directory structure under the session, not in the repo.\n\n2. The critical issue in the hypothesis assumes the tool is trying to infer repoPath from agent logs, but this isn't accurate. The tool knows its session context from the running environment.\n\n3. The actual issue appears to be related to concurrent writes during high-load scenarios (10 agents). Looking at the error handling code:\n```typescript\ntry {\n  await appendFile(observationPath, JSON.stringify(observation) + '\\n');\n  return 'Observation logged';\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error('Failed to write observation:', error);\n  return 'Observation logged'; // <-- Critical bug here\n}\n```\n\nKey findings:\n- The error handling silently fails but returns success\n- During concurrent writes, file system locks or race conditions could cause write failures\n- The high number of concurrent agents (10) makes this much more likely than in small test runs\n- The success message is returned regardless of actual write success\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - this investigation was to validate/invalidate the hypothesis only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Found direct evidence that repoPath is not required for observation writes\n2. Identified actual error handling code that explains the observed behavior\n3. The pattern (works in small tests, fails under load, false success) matches exactly with a silent concurrent write failure\n4. The hypothesis about repoPath and agent logs doesn't match the actual code structure\n\nThe real issue appears to be improper error handling during concurrent writes, not a repoPath problem."
