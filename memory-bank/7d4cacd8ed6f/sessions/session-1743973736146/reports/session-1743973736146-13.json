"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failures stem from improper error handling in the writeObservation chain\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the code structure around observation handling\n- Found critical issues in error propagation and handling\n- Key findings:\n1. The error message in add_observation's catch block never reaches the user because it's wrapped in the same success-style response structure as the success case\n2. Under high load (10 agents), filesystem operations are more likely to fail\n3. writeObservation doesn't have its own error handling, relying entirely on the caller\n4. The mkdir and writeFile operations could fail silently due to:\n   - Permission issues\n   - Disk space issues\n   - File locking under concurrent access\n   - Path length limitations\n   \nThe code examination confirms the hypothesis completely:\n- writeObservation throws raw errors up\n- add_observation catches but presents errors in a non-error format\n- The response structure is identical for both success and failure cases\n- Under high concurrent load, these issues become more pronounced\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone (investigation only)\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure exactly matches the hypothesis\n2. The error handling pattern found is a known anti-pattern that causes exactly this type of silent failure\n3. The behavior matches perfectly with the symptoms:\n   - Success messages always shown\n   - Failures more common under load\n   - No user visibility of actual errors\n4. The timing (during intensive tinygrad debugging with ~10 agents) aligns with when concurrent filesystem operations would be most likely to fail"
