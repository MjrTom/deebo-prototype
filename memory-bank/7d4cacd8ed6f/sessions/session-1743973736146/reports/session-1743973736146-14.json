"HYPOTHESIS: We can fix the observation write failures by properly differentiating between success and error responses in the MCP tool.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined writeObservation implementation and add_observation tool usage\n- Looked for file system operations and error handling patterns\n- Analyzed the context that this occurs during high-concurrency scenarios (~10 agents)\n\nKey findings:\n1. The proposed changes don't address the root cause - they only improve error reporting\n2. The issue manifests during high-concurrency (10 agents) but works in low-concurrency scenarios\n3. The success message is returned AFTER writeObservation completes, suggesting the write operation itself is the problem\n4. File system verification after write wouldn't catch race conditions or partial writes\n\nThe hypothesis focuses on error handling and verification, but the evidence points to a concurrency issue:\n- Works in small test runs\n- Fails under load with multiple agents\n- Write operations appear to complete (no errors thrown) but data isn't persisted\n\nThis suggests potential problems:\n1. File system buffering not being flushed properly\n2. Race conditions between multiple agents writing simultaneously\n3. Resource exhaustion under load\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - the proposed changes would only improve error reporting but not fix the underlying concurrency issue.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe key insight is that this is a concurrency/resource issue, not an error handling one. The evidence strongly supports this:\n1. The system works in low-concurrency scenarios\n2. Failures occur specifically under load\n3. Operations complete \"successfully\" but don't persist\n4. The issue is consistent with file system buffering or resource exhaustion patterns\n\nAlternative hypothesis: We should investigate the writeObservation implementation for proper file system synchronization, perhaps adding:\n- Proper file locking mechanisms\n- Synchronous write operations\n- Buffer flushing guarantees\n- Resource pooling/queuing for concurrent writes"
