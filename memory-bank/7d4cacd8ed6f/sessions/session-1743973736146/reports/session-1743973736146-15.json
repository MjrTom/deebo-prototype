"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failures occur because the add_observation tool's error handling is completely backwards - errors are formatted as successes\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\nI analyzed several key aspects:\n1. The add_observation tool implementation\n2. Error handling patterns across the codebase\n3. The writeObservation function implementation\n\nKey findings:\n1. The error handling in add_observation is indeed problematic:\n   - Success case returns {content: [{type: \"text\", text: \"Observation logged\"}]}\n   - Error case returns nearly identical structure with just different text\n   - This means the MCP protocol cannot distinguish between success and failure\n2. The standard error handling pattern in other tools involves throwing errors or returning error objects\n3. This specific implementation masks all errors from writeObservation by converting them to success-looking messages\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed because:\n1. The code exactly matches the hypothesized structure\n2. The behavior matches the observed symptoms (success messages despite failures)\n3. The error handling deviates from standard patterns in the codebase\n4. This explains why the issue appears during high load (more likely to hit errors) but works in small tests\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made - validation only phase\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The code structure exactly matches the hypothesis\n- The behavior perfectly explains all observed symptoms\n- The error handling pattern clearly deviates from codebase standards\n- This explains both why it appears under load and why small tests work"
