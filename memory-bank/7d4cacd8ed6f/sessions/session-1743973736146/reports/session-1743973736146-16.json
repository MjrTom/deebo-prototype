"HYPOTHESIS: We can fix the observation write failures by correcting the error handling to properly throw errors instead of masking them as successes.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the current codebase focusing on add_observation and writeObservation implementations\n- Reviewed the error handling patterns and failure modes\n- Considered the specific context: failures during high load with ~10 agents but success in small test runs\n\nKey findings:\n1. The proposed error handling changes wouldn't address the core issue because:\n   - The problem occurs during high load but works in small tests\n   - If it was an error handling issue, we would see errors being swallowed, but instead we see successful responses\n   - The error path is never hit (since we get \"Observation logged\" messages)\n2. The high-load vs small-test difference suggests this is likely a concurrency/resource issue:\n   - Multiple agents trying to write simultaneously\n   - Possible file handle exhaustion\n   - Potential race conditions in file system operations\n\nWhy this refutes the hypothesis:\n1. Better error handling wouldn't prevent the initial failure\n2. The system isn't hitting error conditions - it's reporting success but silently failing\n3. The pattern of behavior (works in small tests, fails under load) strongly suggests a concurrency problem rather than an error handling issue\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - the hypothesis was disproven before implementation\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The evidence strongly points to a concurrency/resource issue rather than error handling:\n   - Works in small tests = error handling is fundamentally sound\n   - Fails under load = resource/concurrency problem\n   - Returns success = not hitting error paths\n2. The behavior pattern is classic for concurrency issues\n3. Alternative hypothesis: The issue is likely related to file handle limits, write contention, or similar resource constraints under high concurrency\n\nRecommendation for new direction:\nInvestigate concurrent write handling, potentially:\n- Using a write queue to manage concurrent operations\n- Implementing write batching\n- Adding file handle pooling\n- Monitoring system resource limits during high load scenarios"
