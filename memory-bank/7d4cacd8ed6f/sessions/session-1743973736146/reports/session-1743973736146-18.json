"HYPOTHESIS: We can fix both issues with targeted changes to just the error handling and basic write coordination.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- The key context I took into account was that this only happens during high-concurrency scenarios (10 agents)\n- The existing code already has reasonable error handling that would catch and surface file system errors\n- The hypothesis assumes the primary issue is race conditions in writing, but:\n  1. Node.js's fs.appendFile (writeFile with 'a' flag) is already atomic for appends\n  2. The mkdir lock wouldn't prevent write conflicts since it's only checked once per directory\n  3. The error handling changes wouldn't explain why we get success messages but no writes\n\nKey findings:\n1. The success message indicates the code is executing without throwing errors\n2. File system operations are already atomic for appends\n3. The issue manifests only under high concurrency\n4. Lock directories wouldn't prevent concurrent writes to the same file\n\nThis suggests the real issue may be:\n- Memory pressure or resource exhaustion under high concurrency causing silent failures\n- Event loop saturation preventing writes from completing\n- File handle limits being hit with many concurrent operations\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - the hypothesis appears incorrect\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high that this hypothesis is incorrect because:\n1. The proposed changes don't address the core symptoms (success message but no writes)\n2. Node.js already provides the atomic guarantees we're trying to add\n3. The error handling would still surface errors, but we're seeing success messages\n4. The issue only occurring under high load suggests a resource/concurrency problem rather than a coordination issue"
