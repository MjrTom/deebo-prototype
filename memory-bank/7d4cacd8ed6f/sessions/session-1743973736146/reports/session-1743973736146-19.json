"HYPOTHESIS: The real issue is much simpler - it's purely an error handling problem in add_observation where errors are being returned as success messages instead of being thrown.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Code search confirmed the exact error handling pattern described in the hypothesis\n- The add_observation tool is indeed returning a success-like structure even in error cases\n- This perfectly explains the observed behavior where:\n  1. Users always see \"Observation logged\" or an error message in the same format\n  2. Failed writes appear successful\n  3. The issue becomes more apparent under high load (more likely to hit errors)\n  4. Works fine in small test runs (fewer errors, lower load)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. No changes made yet - but the fix would be to modify the error handling in add_observation to throw errors instead of returning them in a success format\n2. This will allow proper error propagation and make failures visible\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure exactly matches the hypothesis\n2. The behavior perfectly explains all observed symptoms\n3. The explanation is simple and requires no complex interactions\n4. It explains why the issue is more prevalent under high load\n5. It explains why small test runs work fine (fewer errors triggered)\n6. Most importantly, it explains why we always see a \"success\" message format even when writes fail\n\nThis appears to be a classic error-swallowing bug where errors are being transformed into success responses, making it impossible to detect failures at higher levels of the system."
