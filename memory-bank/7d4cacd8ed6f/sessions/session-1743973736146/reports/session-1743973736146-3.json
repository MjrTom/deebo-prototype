"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failure is occurring because the add_observation tool implementation in index.ts is incomplete, missing critical pieces including repoPath, sessionId, and the actual writeObservation call.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the code implementation and found:\n\n1. In src/tools/index.ts, the add_observation tool is indeed incomplete:\n- It starts with finding the memory bank directory and projects\n- But after that initial setup, it's missing the crucial steps to actually write the observation\n\n2. The writeObservation function exists in observations.ts and requires:\n- repoPath: string\n- sessionId: string\n- agentId: string\n- observation: string\n\n3. Key Finding: The add_observation tool implementation is truncated - it has the try block and setup but doesn't follow through with the actual observation writing. It's likely returning \"Observation logged\" prematurely without actually writing anything.\n\n4. This explains why:\n- The tool returns success (\"Observation logged\")\n- But no observations are actually written\n- Small test runs work (they probably used a different path/implementation)\n- The issue manifests under load (more agents = more missed observations)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was an investigation task only.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear code evidence showing the incomplete implementation\n2. The symptoms match exactly what we'd expect from this kind of incomplete implementation\n3. The function signature of writeObservation confirms all the missing pieces identified in the hypothesis\n4. The behavior (success message without actual writing) is consistent with a truncated implementation that returns success without completing its task"
