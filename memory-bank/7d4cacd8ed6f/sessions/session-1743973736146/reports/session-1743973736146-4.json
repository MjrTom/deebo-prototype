"HYPOTHESIS: The observation write failure is occurring because of an error in the session/repo path detection logic in add_observation\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe search results reveal that the hypothesis about session/repo path detection being the root cause is incorrect for several reasons:\n\n1. The code shows that observations are being written in a try-catch block, but the error handling catches ALL errors and returns \"Observation logged\" regardless of success or failure:\n```typescript\ntry {\n  // write observation\n  // ...\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error('Error logging observation:', e);\n  return 'Observation logged'; // THIS is the key issue\n}\n```\n\n2. The session path detection code isn't actually the problem - even if it fails, it would throw an error that would be caught. The real issue is that the error handling silently swallows failures while still reporting success.\n\n3. During intensive debugging with ~10 agents:\n- Write operations could fail due to file locks, disk space, or other IO issues\n- These failures are being masked by the catch-all error handler\n- The success message is misleading users into thinking writes succeeded\n\nKey finding: The observation writing system has a fundamental flaw in its error handling that makes it impossible to detect actual write failures. This perfectly explains why we see \"Observation logged\" but no actual observations in the files.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet - this finding suggests we need to:\n1. Fix the error handling to actually report failures\n2. Add proper error differentiation (path issues vs write issues)\n3. Only return success on confirmed write\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe code pattern found exactly matches the observed behavior:\n- Returns success message regardless of actual outcome\n- Would happen consistently under load\n- Explains why it works in small tests (fewer concurrent writes/less likely to hit IO issues)\n- Previous investigation was misled because the error was hidden\n\nThis is a much simpler and more complete explanation than the session path hypothesis."
