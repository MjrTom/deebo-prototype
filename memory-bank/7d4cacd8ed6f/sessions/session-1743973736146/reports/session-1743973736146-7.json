"HYPOTHESIS: The issue can be fixed by modifying the session detection logic to use actual timestamps and proper error handling\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Context Analysis: The original issue occurs during high concurrency with ~10 agents, but observations work in small test runs\n- Key difference: The problem manifests as write failures, not incorrect session detection\n- The code searches reveal that the current system already uses proper session validation through mother.log\n- The proposed timestamp-based approach wouldn't address the core issue: write operations failing silently during high concurrency\n\nKey Findings:\n1. The success message is returned before write confirmation\n2. The writeObservation function appears to have inadequate error handling\n3. The issue manifests under high load, suggesting a resource contention problem\n4. Session detection is not the bottleneck - the write operations themselves are failing\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - the hypothesis was found to be incorrect\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. The pattern of \"success message but no write\" strongly suggests an asynchronous write failure\n2. The issue only appearing under high load points to resource contention\n3. Session detection works in small test runs, indicating that's not the core problem\n4. The proposed timestamp-based solution wouldn't address the actual failure point (write operations)\n\nAlternative Direction:\nThe actual issue likely lies in:\n1. File handle exhaustion during concurrent writes\n2. Missing await on write operations\n3. Insufficient error propagation from low-level write operations\n4. File system buffering/caching issues under high load\n\nRecommendation: Investigate the writeObservation implementation itself, particularly its error handling and write confirmation mechanisms."
