"HYPOTHESIS: We can solve the observation write failures by implementing proper write confirmation, error handling, and file locking.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\nContext considered: The issue occurs specifically during high-concurrency scenarios with ~10 agents, while working fine in small test runs. The success message is returned despite writes failing.\n\nThis significantly changes my analysis because:\n1. The problem is load/concurrency-specific\n2. Simple writes work fine in low-load situations\n3. The error is silent (success reported despite failure)\n\nKey findings:\n1. File locking and write verification, while good practices, don't address the root cause\n2. The issue manifests only under high load, suggesting a resource contention or timing issue\n3. The verification step could actually make things worse by:\n   - Adding more I/O operations per write\n   - Increasing the time each file handle is held\n   - Creating more opportunities for failure\n\nThe hypothesis is incorrect because:\n1. It assumes write failures are due to lack of proper file operations\n2. But the evidence suggests a higher-level concurrency or resource issue\n3. Adding more I/O operations could exacerbate the problem\n4. The success message despite failure suggests a potential race condition or event loop issue\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Modified observations.ts to implement file locking and write verification\n- However, these changes are not recommended for production\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThis hypothesis can be confidently rejected because:\n1. The symptoms (working in low load, failing in high load) strongly suggest a different class of problem\n2. Adding more I/O operations in a high-load scenario would likely make the issue worse\n3. The proposed solution doesn't address why success is reported despite failure\n\nAlternative direction suggested: Investigate the event handling and async queuing mechanisms, particularly:\n1. How observation writes are queued and processed\n2. Whether there's an event loop overflow\n3. Whether writes are being dropped due to backpressure\n4. How success/failure is being tracked and reported"
