"HYPOTHESIS: The `block_finalize` function, which might be responsible for adding the final SINK UOp, contains logic that incorrectly skips adding the SINK under the specific conditions created by the `test_avg_pool3d_failure` test.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the linearize.py file and found that the SINK UOp handling is more complex than initially assumed\n- The error \"doesn't end with SINK\" comes from schedule validation, not `block_finalize`\n- Key finding: The SINK UOp is actually added by the scheduler during graph linearization, not directly by `block_finalize`\n- The avg_pool3d operation creates a specific graph structure that's causing the scheduler to miss adding the SINK UOp\n- Previous assumption about `block_finalize` being the primary source was incorrect\n\nKey findings:\n1. The SINK UOp is part of the scheduling process, not block finalization\n2. The error occurs in validation after scheduling, not during block finalization\n3. The issue appears to be in how the graph is being linearized for avg_pool3d operations\n4. The hypothesis focused on the wrong component of the system\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - The investigation revealed that the hypothesis was incorrect and focused on the wrong area of the code.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high that the original hypothesis is incorrect because:\n1. Code examination shows SINK handling is primarily in the scheduler, not block_finalize\n2. Test execution reveals the error is in schedule validation\n3. The previous fix attempt's failure makes more sense now - modifying block_finalize wouldn't address the root cause\n4. The actual issue appears to be in the graph linearization process for avg_pool3d operations\n\nRecommendation: Investigation should be redirected to examine the scheduling and linearization logic specifically for avg_pool3d operations, rather than the block_finalize function."
