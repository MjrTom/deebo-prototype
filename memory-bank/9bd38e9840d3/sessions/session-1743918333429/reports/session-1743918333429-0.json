"HYPOTHESIS: The error is occurring due to an unhandled Promise rejection in an async operation, causing the generic \"Something went wrong\" message to surface instead of the actual error details\nCONFIRMED: Cannot Confirm\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Attempted to analyze the codebase for async operations and error handling patterns\n- Searched for specific error messages and \"operation X\" references\n- Tried to examine project structure and file organization\n- Encountered limitations in accessing repository contents\n\nThe investigation was hampered by inability to access the repository contents effectively. Without being able to examine the actual code:\n- Cannot verify presence of unhandled Promise rejections\n- Cannot locate the source of the generic error message\n- Cannot trace the async operation flow\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Unable to make changes without access to repository contents\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\nExplanation: Without access to the actual codebase, I cannot make a definitive determination about the hypothesis. To properly investigate this issue, we would need:\n1. Access to the source code files\n2. Ability to examine the error handling implementation\n3. Context about \"operation X\" and its async nature\n4. Stack traces or error logs if available"
