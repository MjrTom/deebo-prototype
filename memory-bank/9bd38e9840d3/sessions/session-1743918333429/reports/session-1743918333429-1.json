"HYPOTHESIS: The error is related to a type mismatch in operation X where TypeScript's static type checking is failing to catch an runtime type error, possibly due to an 'any' type or incorrect type assertion\nCONFIRMED: Unable to confirm\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Attempted to locate TypeScript source files and configuration\n- Searched for type-related code patterns and \"operation X\" references\n- Tried to compile the project to check for type errors\n- Looked for type assertions and potential type mismatches\n\nKey findings:\n- Cannot locate TypeScript files or TypeScript configuration\n- The repository appears to either not be a TypeScript project or the files are not in the expected location\n- Without access to the relevant TypeScript code, cannot verify type mismatch hypothesis\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- No changes made as core files could not be located\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\nThe inability to locate TypeScript source files or configuration makes it impossible to properly investigate type-related issues. We need more information about:\n1. The actual location of TypeScript files\n2. The specific \"operation X\" that's failing\n3. The complete error stack trace or context\n4. Whether this is actually a TypeScript project"
