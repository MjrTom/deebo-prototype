"HYPOTHESIS: The avg_pool3d operation's linearization process is not properly terminating with a SINK operation, likely due to an edge case in the kernel size or stride parameters that causes the operation's final UOp sequence to be malformed\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Attempted to locate relevant code files containing avg_pool3d implementations\n- Searched for SINK operation usage in the codebase\n- Checked for recent changes in the codebase\n- Examined directory structure for relevant files\n\nThe investigation was significantly hampered by:\n1. Lack of access to specific file paths containing the avg_pool3d implementation\n2. No clear error stack trace or specific test case that reproduces the issue\n3. Unable to find concrete evidence of the avg_pool3d operation's linearization process\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Unable to make changes without access to relevant files or confirmation of the specific implementation details.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\nExplanation: Cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis due to:\n1. Insufficient access to relevant code files\n2. No clear evidence of SINK operation implementation in the accessible codebase\n3. Unable to verify the specific linearization process for avg_pool3d\n4. Lack of specific test case or reproduction steps\n\nAdditional context about the specific files implementing avg_pool3d, the test case that's failing, and the linearization process would be needed to properly investigate this hypothesis."
