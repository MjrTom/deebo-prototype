"HYPOTHESIS: The `block_finalize` function in the linearizer is failing to add the required SINK operation specifically for 3D pooling operations because it's not correctly handling the dimensionality of the operation - it may be treating the 3D pool as a 2D pool operation internally\n\nCONFIRMED: Unable to determine\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Attempted to examine the codebase through various search patterns\n- Looked for references to block_finalize, pooling operations, and SINK operations\n- Tried to understand the repository structure\n- Unable to access or find the relevant code files\n\nThe investigation was hampered by:\n1. Inability to access or find the relevant source code files\n2. No response from directory listing tools\n3. Possible issues with repository access or structure\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Unable to make changes without access to the relevant code\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\nCannot make a determination about the hypothesis without access to the relevant source code. We need:\n1. Access to the linearizer implementation\n2. Access to the pooling operation implementations\n3. Ability to examine how SINK operations are handled"
