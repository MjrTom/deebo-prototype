Not being properly propagated up through the nested structure during make_basic_blocks\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the block creation and merging process in detail, focusing on:\n1. The UOp sequence generation for 3D pooling\n2. The make_basic_blocks implementation\n3. The block_merge logic\n4. How nested loops are handled\n\nKey findings:\n1. The SINK operation isn't actually being removed during block_merge - the merging logic is working correctly\n2. The issue occurs earlier in make_basic_blocks\n3. The problem is that the nested structure isn't correctly handling terminal blocks in deeply nested loops (3D case)\n4. In particular, when a nested loop ends, its SINK operation should propagate up to become part of the parent loop's terminal block\n\nThe hypothesis was partially correct in identifying that nested loops were the core issue, but incorrect about where in the pipeline the problem manifests. It's not the block merging that loses the SINK, but rather the initial basic block formation that fails to properly propagate terminal operations up through nested structures.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet - this was a validation phase to locate the exact issue\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nMy confidence is high because:\n1. The debug traces clearly show the SINK operation is missing before block_merge is called\n2. The behavior consistently differs between 2D and 3D cases due to nesting depth\n3. The issue manifests in make_basic_blocks, which aligns with the nested loop handling being the root cause\n4. Similar patterns are seen in other complex nested loop scenarios\n\nThe bug fix would need to focus on modifying make_basic_blocks to properly propagate terminal operations up through nested structures, rather than changes to block_merge as initially hypothesized.\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/tinygrad"}}
