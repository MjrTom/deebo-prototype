The block.arg.lst contains the SINK operation\n2. But block.src contains operations that are being incorrectly appended after the merge\n3. This suggests the avg_pool3d implementation might be generating UOps in an order that breaks the standard block structure\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe investigation revealed several key points:\n\n1. The issue is not specific to avg_pool3d's implementation, but rather a more fundamental issue in how blocks are merged and finalized.\n\n2. In linearize.py, the block finalization process assumes SINK operations should always be at the end of block.arg.lst, but this assumption isn't always maintained during block merging.\n\n3. The core issue appears to be in the Block class where operations can be added to block.src after a SINK has been added to block.arg.lst. This is a structural issue in the block management rather than specific to avg_pool3d.\n\nKey findings:\n1. The assertion error occurs in block_finalize when checking if the last operation is SINK\n2. The block merging process doesn't properly handle preserving SINK operation placement\n3. avg_pool3d is just one of potentially many operations that could trigger this issue\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet, as this investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning:\n1. Clear evidence in the code shows this is a block management issue rather than an avg_pool3d specific problem\n2. The hypothesis was partially correct about SINK placement being the issue, but incorrect about it being specific to avg_pool3d\n3. Found multiple instances where block merging could lead to this situation, suggesting a systematic issue rather than an operation-specific one\n\nAlternative Solution Direction:\nRather than focusing on avg_pool3d, the fix should focus on:\n1. Ensuring block merging preserves SINK operation ordering\n2. Implementing proper safeguards in block.src modifications when SINK exists in block.arg.lst\n3. Possibly rethinking the assumption that SINK must always be the last operation\n</report>\n\nThis investigation suggests we should pivot from focusing on avg_pool3d specifically to addressing the underlying block management issue in the linearization process."},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/tinygrad"}}
