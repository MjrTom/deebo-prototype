"HYPOTHESIS: The assertion error occurs because the block merging process in block_finalize is not properly handling the order of operations when combining block.src with block.arg.lst. Specifically:\n1. The SINK UOp might be getting moved from its expected final position during the merge\n2. The combine operation is likely appending block.src after block.arg.lst without ensuring SINK remains at the end\n3. This suggests the current implementation assumes SINK will naturally end up last, but this assumption is failing\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the block_finalize implementation in linearize.py\n- Found that the code combines operations using self.arg.lst.extend(self.src)\n- The SINK operation is initially placed in arg.lst\n- The current implementation assumes SINK will stay at the end naturally\n- No explicit handling exists to ensure SINK remains the final operation\n\nKey findings:\n1. The block_finalize method does indeed merge block.src after block.arg.lst without special handling of SINK\n2. When block.src has operations, they get appended after block.arg.lst, potentially pushing operations after SINK\n3. No mechanism exists to reorder operations ensuring SINK remains last\n4. Current implementation uses a naive assertion rather than enforcing the invariant\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n- The merge operation is a simple extension without order preservation\n- No special handling exists for SINK positioning\n- The assumption that SINK will naturally end up last is proven false\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet, but recommended fix would involve:\n1. Extracting SINK from arg.lst before merge\n2. Combining the remaining operations\n3. Explicitly appending SINK at the end\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The code clearly shows the merging behavior exactly matching the hypothesis\n- The lack of SINK position management is evident\n- The failure pattern aligns perfectly with the hypothesis\n- Code structure confirms the order of operations issue"
