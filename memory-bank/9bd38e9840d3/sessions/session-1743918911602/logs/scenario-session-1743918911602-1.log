When processing the avg_pool3d operation:\n1. The SINK UOp is created but its dependencies are not properly captured\n2. This causes it to be incorrectly ordered in the final block\n3.

You do not need to fix the entire bug — your focus is the truth of the SPECIFIC hypothesis you are assigned to.\nThat being said, don't be too hasty to report a conclusion. If you see something potentially useful/interesting, investigate it further. Debugging is a complicated, nonlinear process, and subtle clues could be useful.\nIMPORTANT:\n- READ THE CONTEXT CAREFULLY: \"Debugging `test_avg_pool3d_failure`. The error `AssertionError: doesn't end with SINK` occurs in `block_finalize`. Previous attempts showed: 1) Modifying `make_basic_blocks` caused RecursionError. 2) Modifying `block_finalize` to find the SINK failed with `AssertionError: SINK UOp not found in block list`. This indicates the SINK UOp, initially created, is lost *before* `block_finalize`. The current hypothesis is that the block building/merging logic (`append_to_block` or `block_merge`) mishandles the SINK UOp when processing the complex graph from 3D pooling, causing it to be dropped or misplaced.\"\n- This contains what approaches have failed and why\n- Don't waste time repeating failed attempts\n- These are instructions, not suggestions.
