"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK UOp is being lost during block merging operations in complex graphs. Specifically:\n1. The SINK UOp is correctly created initially\n2. During the block merging phase in complex 3D pooling operations, either:\n   - The block containing SINK is incorrectly merged with another block\n   - Or the SINK node is dropped when blocks are reordered\n3. This happens because the block merging logic (`block_merge`) doesn't properly track or preserve terminal nodes like SINK\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Added detailed logging to track SINK UOp creation and block merging operations\n- Examined the block merging logic in linearize.py\n- Found that block_merge doesn't have special handling for terminal nodes like SINK\n- Key finding: During block merging, when a block containing SINK is merged with another block, the SINK operation is treated like any other operation and can be reordered or displaced\n- This is critical because SINK needs to maintain its position at the end of the block\n\nKey findings:\n1. The block_merge function treats all UOps equally without special consideration for terminal operations\n2. In complex graphs like 3D pooling, multiple merge operations occur, increasing the chance of SINK displacement\n3. The issue isn't that SINK is being dropped, but rather that it's losing its terminal position during merges\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added debug logging to block_merge and linearize functions\n2. Added specific tracking for SINK UOp creation and processing\nThese changes were made to trace the flow of SINK operations through the merge process\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The debug logs clearly show the SINK UOp being created but losing its terminal position during merges\n2. The behavior matches exactly with the hypothesis - SINK exists but isn't properly preserved as a terminal node\n3. This explains both symptoms: why the SINK exists in the block list but isn't at the end, and why complex operations like 3D pooling trigger the issue more frequently"
