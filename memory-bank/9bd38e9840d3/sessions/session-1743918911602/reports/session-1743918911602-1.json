"HYPOTHESIS: The issue is in the UOp dependency tracking during linearization. When processing the avg_pool3d operation:\n1. The SINK UOp is created but its dependencies are not properly captured\n2. This causes it to be incorrectly ordered in the final block\n3. The assertion fails because another operation ends up being the last one instead of SINK\n4. This specifically happens with 3D pooling due to its complex graph structure creating circular dependencies that confuse the topological ordering\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the linearize.py code and added debug logging to track UOp creation and dependency handling\n- Analyzed how SINK UOps are created and tracked in the system\n- Added logging to monitor UOp addition and dependency tracking\n- Traced the execution path through the test case\n\nKey findings:\n1. The SINK UOp is actually properly created and its dependencies are correctly captured initially\n2. The issue is not with dependency tracking during linearization, but rather with block merging\n3. The problem occurs in the block merging phase where the SINK UOp is being dropped entirely\n4. The complex graph structure from 3D pooling is not creating circular dependencies - the topological ordering is working correctly\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added debug logging in linearize() to track UOp list before finalization\n2. Added debug logging in add_uop() to track dependency creation\n3. Added global_uop tracking variable\nThese changes were for investigation purposes only and can be reverted.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High \nThe hypothesis is incorrect because:\n1. The debug output shows the SINK UOp is properly created with correct dependencies\n2. The topological ordering is working as expected\n3. The issue manifests when blocks are merged, not during dependency tracking\n4. The debug logs show the SINK UOp actually disappears during block merging operations\n\nThe real issue appears to be in the block merging logic, where the SINK UOp is being dropped or mishandled when blocks are combined, rather than in the dependency tracking system as hypothesized."
