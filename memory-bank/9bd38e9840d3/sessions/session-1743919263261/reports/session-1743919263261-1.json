"HYPOTHESIS: H2: Incomplete Block Merging\nThe issue might be in the block_merge phase where:\n1. The 3D pooling creates multiple parallel execution paths (for each dimension)\n2. These paths should eventually merge back to the SINK\n3. But the merge conditions are failing to properly combine all paths, leaving some blocks \"floating\" without connection to SINK\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the block_merge implementation and how it handles successor relationships\n- Added instrumentation to track block merging behavior specifically for 3D pooling paths\n- Analyzed the block connectivity patterns during merging\n\nKey findings:\n1. The block_merge algorithm assumes a simpler graph structure where all paths converge directly to their final destination\n2. In 3D pooling, we have a more complex pattern where:\n   - Multiple parallel paths exist (one per dimension)\n   - Some paths merge at intermediate points\n   - The intermediate merges create \"islands\" of merged blocks that lose their connection to the final SINK\n3. The current successor tracking doesn't handle this multi-level merging properly\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added debug instrumentation to block_merge:\n   - Added debug_block_info helper function\n   - Added logging of block processing stages\n   - Purpose: To verify the block connectivity patterns during merging\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe debug output confirms that during block_merge:\n1. Some blocks are merging correctly at intermediate points\n2. But after these intermediate merges, the algorithm fails to maintain the path to SINK\n3. This matches exactly with the hypothesis and explains why the SINK gets disconnected\n\nThis suggests we need to modify the block_merge algorithm to:\n1. Track multi-level successor relationships\n2. Preserve paths to SINK even after intermediate merges\n3. Handle the specific case of converging parallel paths in 3D operations"
