"HYPOTHESIS: H3: Multi-Level Merge Path Loss\nThe block merging algorithm is losing SINK connectivity because:\n1. Initial blocks are created with correct SINK nodes\n2. During intermediate merges of parallel paths, the SINK node gets disconnected\n3. The algorithm fails to properly propagate the SINK relationship through merged blocks\n4. This happens specifically when paths merge in stages (like in 3D pooling) rather than all at once\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI analyzed the block merging mechanism in linearize.py and how it handles complex multi-stage merging operations like those in 3D pooling. Key findings:\n\n1. The block_merge function assumes a simple two-way merge pattern while 3D pooling creates a multi-level merge hierarchy\n2. The SINK node gets assigned to the last block in simple merges, but with staged merges, this assignment doesn't propagate correctly\n3. The 3D pooling operation creates nested merge patterns that confuse the current merging logic\n4. The UOp graph for 3D pooling is significantly more complex than 2D pooling, with multiple levels of reduction operations\n\nKey evidence:\n- The linearize.py code shows that blocks are initially created with correct SINK nodes\n- The block_merge function lacks proper handling for nested merge hierarchies\n- The error occurs before block_finalize, confirming the issue is in the merge process\n- Previous attempts to fix individual components failed because the issue is in the merge path propagation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This was a hypothesis validation task. However, this investigation points to needed changes in the block_merge function to properly handle multi-level merge hierarchies.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. The evidence directly matches all four points of the hypothesis\n2. The code structure confirms that block merging is the point where SINK connectivity is lost\n3. The timing of the error (before block_finalize) matches our hypothesis about merge-time issues\n4. The specific failure in 3D pooling (but not simpler operations) confirms the multi-level merge aspect\n5. Previous failed attempts at fixing individual components support the hypothesis that this is a structural issue in the merge process"
