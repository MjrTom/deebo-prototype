"HYPOTHESIS: H4: SINK Block Preservation\nThe root cause is that the initial SINK block (created by the first pattern in make_basic_blocks) is being merged too early. Instead, it should be:\n1. Preserved as a separate block until final merging\n2. Given special treatment in append_to_block to prevent premature merging\n3. Only merged during the final block_finalize step\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the linearize.py code and test behavior carefully, focusing on the SINK block handling. Key findings:\n\n1. The issue appears to be more fundamental than just SINK block preservation. In the avg_pool3d case, the UOp graph has several characteristics that make it different:\n   - Multiple nested reductions due to 3D kernel\n   - More complex data dependencies\n   - Higher likelihood of multiple paths to the same UOp due to the 3D nature\n\n2. The SINK UOp isn't actually being merged prematurely. Instead, the core issue appears to be that the complex graph structure from avg_pool3d is causing alternate paths to be created that bypass the SINK node entirely.\n\n3. Looking at the code flow:\n   - make_basic_blocks() correctly creates the initial SINK block\n   - The SINK disappears not from merging but from the graph getting reconstructed in ways that don't preserve the original data flow guarantees\n\n4. This hypothesis focuses on block merging behavior, but the evidence suggests the problem lies in the initial graph traversal and block formation stage before any merging occurs.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made, as the investigation revealed the hypothesis was incorrect.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code analysis shows that even perfect SINK block preservation wouldn't fix the core issue\n2. The error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" is a symptom of a deeper graph structure problem\n3. The fact that this only happens with avg_pool3d suggests the issue is specific to complex graph structures, not block merging\n4. Previous failed attempts that focused on block merging and SINK preservation validate that this approach is not the solution\n\nAlternative Direction:\nThe investigation suggests we should instead focus on:\n1. The initial graph traversal in make_basic_blocks() and how it handles complex multi-path reductions\n2. Ensuring data dependencies are properly captured for 3D kernel operations\n3. Adding validation steps during graph construction to ensure critical paths through the SINK are preserved"
