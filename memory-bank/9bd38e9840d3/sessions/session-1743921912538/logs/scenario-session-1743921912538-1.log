Empty initial context in make_basic_blocks\n2. Poor context propagation in linearize_uop\n3. Strict context matching in block_merge\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined:\n- The linearize.py implementation focusing on block merging and context handling\n- The SINK operation handling throughout the codebase\n- The AvgPool3D implementation and its graph structure\n- Block merging and context propagation logic\n\nKey findings:\n1. The hypothesis about empty initial context is correct but incomplete. The issue isn't just that the context is empty, but that the SINK's block context requirements change based on the complexity of the operation that precedes it.\n\n2. The context propagation issue is different than hypothesized. The problem isn't in linearize_uop's general context propagation, but specifically in how pooling operations generate multiple intermediate blocks that need different contexts, making it difficult for the SINK to maintain consistent context across all paths.\n\n3. The block_merge hypothesis is incorrect. The issue isn't with strict context matching, but rather with the order of operations during the final block assembly. The SINK can become disconnected when intermediate blocks are merged before the SINK's proper context is established.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made as this was an investigative session.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\n\nExplanation:\n- High confidence about the findings regarding context initialization and block merging behavior\n- Medium confidence about the exact mechanism of disconnection during pooling operations\n- Need more investigation into the specific interaction between pooling's multi-path execution and SINK context propagation\n\nThe hypothesis captured part of the problem but missed the crucial timing aspect - it's not just about context matching, but about the sequence in which blocks are processed and merged during complex operations like 3D pooling. Fixing this likely requires ensuring SINK blocks are processed last and maintain their context through all potential execution paths.\n</report>"},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/tinygrad"}}
