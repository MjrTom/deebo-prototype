You do not need to fix the entire bug — your focus is the truth of the SPECIFIC hypothesis you are assigned to.\nThat being said, don't be too hasty to report a conclusion. If you see something potentially useful/interesting, investigate it further. Debugging is a complicated, nonlinear process, and subtle clues could be useful.\nIMPORTANT:\n- READ THE CONTEXT CAREFULLY: \"The test `test_avg_pool3d_failure` fails because the SINK UOp gets disconnected during graph rewriting in `linearize_uop`. This happens specifically for the complex graph generated by 3D pooling. Previous attempts to fix this by adjusting the SINK block's context calculation (both by explicitly setting `block_ctxs[sink]` and by modifying the `make_basic_blocks` lambda) were insufficient. The core issue seems to be in the block merging logic (`append_to_block` or `block_merge`) which fails to correctly combine the SINK block with its source blocks when contexts differ or the graph is complex. Need help identifying the exact point of failure in the rewrite/merge logic or finding a better strategy to ensure the SINK stays connected.\"\n- This contains what approaches have failed and why\n- Don't waste time repeating failed attempts\n- These are instructions, not suggestions.

The linearize_uop function and its block creation/merging logic\n2. How SINK blocks are handled in the processing order\n3. The relationship between pooling operations and block contexts\n\nKey findings:\n1. The issue is NOT a race condition - the processing is deterministic and sequential\n2. The root cause appears to be more fundamental: the block merging algorithm doesn't properly account for the topological dependencies created by 3D pooling operations\n3. The SINK disconnection happens because the linearization process fails to maintain the correct order of operations when merging blocks, not because of parallel path issues\n\nThe hypothesis misidentified the core problem as being about parallel execution paths and race conditions. Instead, the evidence shows:\n1. The issue manifests in the topological sorting phase of linearization\n2. Blocks are processed sequentially, not in parallel\n3. The actual problem is in the block dependency tracking, not in context propagation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence in the code that block processing is sequential, not parallel\n2. The error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" indicates a topological ordering issue\n3. The SINK disconnection is consistent with improper dependency tracking rather than race conditions\n4.
