You do not need to fix the entire bug — your focus is the truth of the SPECIFIC hypothesis you are assigned to.\nThat being said, don't be too hasty to report a conclusion. If you see something potentially useful/interesting, investigate it further. Debugging is a complicated, nonlinear process, and subtle clues could be useful.\nIMPORTANT:\n- READ THE CONTEXT CAREFULLY: \"The test `test_avg_pool3d_failure` fails because the SINK UOp gets disconnected during graph rewriting in `linearize_uop`. This happens specifically for the complex graph generated by 3D pooling. Previous attempts to fix this by adjusting the SINK block's context calculation (both by explicitly setting `block_ctxs[sink]` and by modifying the `make_basic_blocks` lambda) were insufficient. The core issue seems to be in the block merging logic (`append_to_block` or `block_merge`) which fails to correctly combine the SINK block with its source blocks when contexts differ or the graph is complex. Need help identifying the exact point of failure in the rewrite/merge logic or finding a better strategy to ensure the SINK stays connected.\"\n- This contains what approaches have failed and why\n- Don't waste time repeating failed attempts\n- These are instructions, not suggestions.
