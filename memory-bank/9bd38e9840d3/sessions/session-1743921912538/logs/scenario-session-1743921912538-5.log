Key findings:\n\n1. The SINK operation is actually preserved during initial block formation - the empty context () is intentional and working as designed\n2. The real issue occurs during the block merging phase in `block_merge`:\n```python\ndef block_merge(blocks: List[BasicBlock]) -> BasicBlock:\n  all_nodes = tuple([x for block in blocks for x in block.nodes])\n  return BasicBlock(merge_ctxs([block.context for block in blocks]), all_nodes)\n```\n\nThe problem isn't that the SINK is being dropped during formation, but rather that during merging:\n- The blocks are being concatenated without preserving the critical ordering between source operations and SINK\n- The merge_ctxs function may be combining contexts in a way that loses the relationship between the SINK and its dependencies\n\nThis explains why the issue manifests specifically in complex graphs like 3D pooling - the more complex dependency chain makes proper ordering more critical.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This investigation was to validate/invalidate the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Found direct evidence in the code that initial block formation preserves SINK\n2. Traced the actual problem to block merging phase\n3. This aligns with the error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" - if SINK was dropped in formation, we'd see a different error\n4. This explains why previous attempts to fix context calculation didn't work - they were addressing the wrong phase of processing\n</report>\n\nThis investigation suggests a different approach is needed - focusing on the block merging logic rather than initial block formation. The real solution likely involves ensuring proper ordering preservation during block merges, particularly for SINK operations in complex dependency chains."},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/tinygrad"}}
