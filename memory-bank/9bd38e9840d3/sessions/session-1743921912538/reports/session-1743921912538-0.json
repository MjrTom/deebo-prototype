"HYPOTHESIS: The issue occurs because the block merging logic in linearize_uop is using context comparisons that are too strict, causing the SINK block to remain isolated when it should be merged with its predecessor blocks.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Added extensive debug logging to track:\n  1. Block merge attempts and their context comparisons\n  2. SINK operation context and predecessor information\n  3. Block appending operations\n\nKey findings:\n1. The SINK operation is being placed in a separate block due to context mismatches\n2. The context comparison in block_merge is too strict - it's doing an exact equality check\n3. The 3D pooling operation creates multiple paths with slightly different contexts that should logically merge\n4. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where a SINK node should merge with a predecessor despite minor context differences\n\nThe debug output revealed that the contexts differ in ways that don't actually affect the correctness of merging - specifically, temporary variable mappings that aren't relevant to the actual computation flow.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added debug logging in append_to_block\n2. Added debug logging in block_merge\n3. Added SINK-specific debugging function\n4. Instrumented the main linearization loop\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe debug output clearly shows the context comparison failing in cases where merging would be valid. This confirms our hypothesis that the strict context equality check is the root cause. The complex nature of 3D pooling creates multiple valid paths that should be merged but are being kept separate due to overly strict comparison.\n\nNext steps would be to:\n1. Modify the context comparison to be more flexible, perhaps by implementing a \"compatible_contexts\" function that checks only relevant parts\n2. Add special handling for SINK operations to allow merging with predecessor blocks when safe to do so\n3. Consider adding a pre-merge context normalization step for paths that are known to be equivalent"
