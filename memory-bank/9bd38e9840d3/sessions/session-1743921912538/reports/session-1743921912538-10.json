"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because of unbalanced dimension handling in the context tracking during linearization, causing mismatched dimension ordering and SINK disconnection during block merges.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined block context tracking in linearize_uop\n- Analyzed block merging logic, particularly block_merge function\n- Studied how SINK operations are handled during block finalization\n- Found that dimension ordering is maintained within blocks, but structural relationships are lost during merges\n\nKey findings:\n1. The issue isn't with dimension ordering as hypothesized\n2. The real problem is in the block_merge function treating operations as a flat set\n3. Block merging loses structural relationships between operations\n4. SINK disconnection happens due to loss of hierarchical block structure, not dimension order mismatch\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Investigation phase only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe investigation clearly shows that while the hypothesis captured the symptom (SINK disconnection), it misidentified the root cause. The evidence in the code, particularly in block_merge, shows that the issue is with structural relationship preservation during merging rather than dimension ordering. The high confidence comes from:\n1. Clear evidence in the block_merge implementation\n2. Consistent pattern of relationship loss during merging\n3. Direct connection to the SINK disconnection symptom"
