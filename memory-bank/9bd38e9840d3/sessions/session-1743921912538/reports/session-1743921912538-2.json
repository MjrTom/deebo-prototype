"HYPOTHESIS: \"The core issue is a race condition in block processing order that can cause the SINK to become disconnected due to improper handling of parallel execution paths in 3D pooling operations.\"\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI carefully examined the linearization code and block handling logic, particularly focusing on:\n1. The linearize_uop function and its block creation/merging logic\n2. How SINK blocks are handled in the processing order\n3. The relationship between pooling operations and block contexts\n\nKey findings:\n1. The issue is NOT a race condition - the processing is deterministic and sequential\n2. The root cause appears to be more fundamental: the block merging algorithm doesn't properly account for the topological dependencies created by 3D pooling operations\n3. The SINK disconnection happens because the linearization process fails to maintain the correct order of operations when merging blocks, not because of parallel path issues\n\nThe hypothesis misidentified the core problem as being about parallel execution paths and race conditions. Instead, the evidence shows:\n1. The issue manifests in the topological sorting phase of linearization\n2. Blocks are processed sequentially, not in parallel\n3. The actual problem is in the block dependency tracking, not in context propagation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence in the code that block processing is sequential, not parallel\n2. The error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" indicates a topological ordering issue\n3. The SINK disconnection is consistent with improper dependency tracking rather than race conditions\n4. Previous fix attempts focusing on context calculation failed because they addressed a symptom rather than the cause\n\nThe investigation suggests a new direction: focusing on improving the topological sorting and dependency tracking in the block merging algorithm, rather than addressing non-existent race conditions."
