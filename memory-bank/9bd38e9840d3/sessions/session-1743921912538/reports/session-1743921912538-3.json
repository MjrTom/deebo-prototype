"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because the block merging algorithm fails to maintain proper topological ordering during linearization, specifically:\n1. The 3D pooling operation creates a complex graph with multiple layers of dependencies\n2. During block merging, the algorithm loses track of these dependencies\n3. When blocks are reordered, the SINK can end up disconnected because its predecessors aren't properly tracked\n4. The issue isn't about context propagation or race conditions, but about maintaining correct topological ordering through all merge steps\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe hypothesis while reasonable on the surface, is not actually correct. After examining the code deeply, I found:\n\n1. The linearization algorithm (`linearize_uop`) actually maintains proper topological ordering through its use of the `ready` set and processing of dependencies. The issue is not with losing track of dependencies during merging.\n\n2. The key finding is that the SINK disconnection happens because of how blocks are split and merged based on contexts, not because of topological ordering issues. The code in `make_basic_blocks` correctly tracks dependencies and maintains ordering.\n\n3. The real problem appears to be in how the SINK block is handled when contexts differ. The current block merging logic prioritizes context matching over maintaining SINK connectivity. This is evidenced by the presence of context checks in the merge logic that can prevent the SINK from being properly merged with its predecessors.\n\n4. Looking at `linearize.py`, the SINK handling is special-cased in several places, suggesting that the issue is more about the interaction between context handling and SINK preservation rather than dependency tracking.\n\n5. The '3D pooling creates complex graph' part of the hypothesis is true, but the complexity manifests in terms of differing contexts rather than complex dependencies.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the hypothesis was found to be incorrect. However, this investigation suggests that the fix should focus on:\n1. Modifying the block merging criteria to prioritize SINK connectivity while respecting contexts\n2. Potentially adding special handling for SINK blocks during merging operations to ensure they stay connected regardless of context differences\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code clearly shows that topological ordering is maintained through careful dependency tracking\n2. The failure occurs specifically in cases with context differences, not in cases where only complex dependencies exist\n3. The SINK disconnection persists even when the topological order is correct, indicating the root cause lies elsewhere\n4. The special handling of SINK nodes throughout the code suggests the issue is more about context handling than dependency tracking"
