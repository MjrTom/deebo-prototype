"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because of overly strict context matching in block merging, specifically due to exact context matching requirements preventing compatible blocks from merging.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the original failure: \"doesn't end with SINK\" assertion error\n- Reviewed block construction and merging logic in linearize.py\n- Examined the test case execution and error pattern\n\nKey findings:\n1. The error occurs in block_finalize() because the SINK UOp is completely missing from the block, not just disconnected\n2. This happens before context matching becomes relevant\n3. The issue appears to be in block construction/collection rather than merging\n4. The error indicates the SINK operation is being dropped during initial block formation, before we even get to context-based merging\n\nThe hypothesis about context matching being too strict is incorrect because:\n- The error occurs at a more fundamental level (missing SINK)\n- We never reach the context comparison stage\n- The assertion failure proves the SINK is missing from the block's UOp list entirely\n\nAlternative hypothesis:\nThe real issue is likely in how UOps are collected into blocks during the initial block formation phase. The SINK operation is probably being dropped or mishandled during this stage, before any context-based merging occurs.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone (hypothesis disproven)\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence is clear and direct:\n1. The assertion error explicitly shows the SINK is missing\n2. This occurs in block_finalize before any context matching\n3. The error pattern is inconsistent with context matching issues\n4. The timing and location of the failure conclusively rules out our original hypothesis"
