"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK operation is being dropped during initial block formation in `make_basic_blocks` because of empty context and dependency tracking issues.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI investigated the code flow through linearize.py and found that the hypothesis about initial block formation being the problem is incorrect. Key findings:\n\n1. The SINK operation is actually preserved during initial block formation - the empty context () is intentional and working as designed\n2. The real issue occurs during the block merging phase in `block_merge`:\n```python\ndef block_merge(blocks: List[BasicBlock]) -> BasicBlock:\n  all_nodes = tuple([x for block in blocks for x in block.nodes])\n  return BasicBlock(merge_ctxs([block.context for block in blocks]), all_nodes)\n```\n\nThe problem isn't that the SINK is being dropped during formation, but rather that during merging:\n- The blocks are being concatenated without preserving the critical ordering between source operations and SINK\n- The merge_ctxs function may be combining contexts in a way that loses the relationship between the SINK and its dependencies\n\nThis explains why the issue manifests specifically in complex graphs like 3D pooling - the more complex dependency chain makes proper ordering more critical.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - This investigation was to validate/invalidate the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Found direct evidence in the code that initial block formation preserves SINK\n2. Traced the actual problem to block merging phase\n3. This aligns with the error message \"doesn't end with SINK\" - if SINK was dropped in formation, we'd see a different error\n4. This explains why previous attempts to fix context calculation didn't work - they were addressing the wrong phase of processing"
