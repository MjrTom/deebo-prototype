"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because the block merging algorithm in `block_merge` doesn't properly preserve ordering guarantees when merging blocks.\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the complete linearization process, focusing on block formation, SINK handling, and merging\n- Traced the dependency flow from initial graph to final linearized form\n- Examined block_merge implementation and its role in the pipeline\n- Verified how SINK dependencies are managed throughout the process\n\nKey findings:\n1. The block_merge function is actually working as intended - it preserves existing dependencies and ordering through the src/lst relationships\n2. The real issue occurs BEFORE block_merge is called - in the initial block formation and connection phase\n3. The SINK disconnection happens because its block isn't properly connected in the dependency graph during basic block formation\n4. block_merge can only work with the dependencies it receives - if blocks aren't properly connected beforehand, merging can't fix it\n\nThe hypothesis is incorrect because:\n- It assumes block_merge is responsible for creating/enforcing ordering constraints\n- In reality, block_merge just preserves existing dependencies - it doesn't create new ones\n- The ordering issue stems from earlier in the pipeline where blocks are initially formed and connected\n- If dependencies are correct before merge, the merging preserves them naturally\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Investigation was focused on validating/invalidating the hypothesis rather than implementing fixes\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The code paths and data flow are very clear\n- We can see exactly where and how blocks are formed, connected, and merged\n- The SINK operation's placement is determined by dependencies established during block formation\n- The block_merge function demonstrably preserves existing dependencies, showing it's not the source of the ordering issue"
