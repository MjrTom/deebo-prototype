"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because initial block formation in `make_basic_blocks` doesn't properly establish all necessary dependencies for the SINK operation.\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI investigated the code flow from SINK creation through block formation and merging. The key findings contradict the original hypothesis:\n\n1. The SINK block formation in `make_basic_blocks` is actually working correctly - it captures all immediate dependencies via x.src and any NAME dependencies\n2. The issue is not in the initial dependency capture, but in how these blocks are processed during linearization\n3. The problem occurs in the linearize_uop function when processing complex graphs:\n   - Blocks are ordered based on dependencies\n   - The SINK's position in the final linearized output depends on the topological sort\n   - The error \"doesn't end with SINK\" suggests the SINK is being reordered incorrectly during linearization\n\nThe real issue is that the linearization process doesn't enforce the constraint that SINK operations must come last in the linearized sequence. This is separate from the dependency tracking in block formation.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - as the hypothesis was incorrect, no changes were warranted based on it.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The error message specifically indicates a linearization ordering problem (\"doesn't end with SINK\")\n2. The code inspection shows the initial block formation correctly captures dependencies\n3. The hypothesis focused on initial dependency capture, but the evidence points to incorrect ordering during linearization\n4. Previous failed attempts at fixing context calculation support this conclusion, as they were addressing a symptom rather than the core ordering issue\n\nAlternative Direction:\nThe investigation suggests we should look at the topological sorting in linearize_uop and how it handles SINK operations. We may need to add special handling to ensure SINK operations are always placed last in the linearized sequence, regardless of their dependencies."
