"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs because the linearization process in `linearize_uop` doesn't properly enforce SINK operations being last in the sequence.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the linearization process in detail, focusing on block formation, merging, and finalization. Key findings:\n\n1. The issue isn't in the block_reorder function as hypothesized (this doesn't actually exist), but rather in how blocks are merged in pm_block_merge\n2. During graph_rewrite with a function processing basic blocks, the SINK operation preservation depends on two key factors:\n   - The block formation in make_basic_blocks creates separate blocks based on context\n   - The merging in pm_block_merge combines blocks based on dependencies\n\n3. Critical observation: The assertion failure happens not because of priority calculation issues, but because the block merging can create invalid orderings when dealing with complex dependency graphs like in 3D pooling.\n\nThe root cause differs from the hypothesis in that:\n- It's not about priority calculations\n- The issue occurs during block merging, not reordering\n- The SINK disconnection happens due to improper block combination, not priority miscalculation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone yet - but the investigation suggests the fix needs to focus on the block merging logic rather than priority calculations.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Found clear evidence in the code that block merging is the critical point\n2. The assertion failure message directly indicates sequence order issue, not priority\n3. The context about 3D pooling creating complex graphs aligns with block merging being the problem point\n\nNext steps should focus on ensuring the block merging logic preserves SINK at the end of its containing block, rather than trying to modify priority calculations."
