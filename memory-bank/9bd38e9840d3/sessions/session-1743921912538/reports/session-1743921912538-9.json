"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK disconnection occurs in `pm_block_merge` because the block merging logic doesn't properly handle the SINK's position when combining blocks.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI analyzed the code with focus on:\n1. How blocks are merged in `block_merge`\n2. The SINK operation's position preservation\n3. How multiple blocks from 3D pooling are handled\n\nKey findings:\n1. The original `block_merge` blindly extends lists without checking SINK positions\n2. Using `to_append.extend(u.arg.lst)` can indeed place operations after SINK\n3. The order of operations isn't validated during merging\n4. When merging multiple blocks (common in 3D pooling), the SINK can end up in the middle\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed because:\n1. No position validation for SINK operations during merging\n2. The list extension approach doesn't preserve SINK's terminal position\n3. Multiple block merges can interleave operations incorrectly\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added SINK position tracking in block_merge\n2. Modified the merging logic to validate SINK position\n3. Added explicit error checking for SINK appearing in middle of merged block\n\nThese changes were needed because:\n- SINK must always be the terminal operation\n- Blind list extension doesn't guarantee this\n- Complex graphs need explicit position validation\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The code paths clearly show the issue\n- SINK position isn't preserved during merging\n- Test failures directly correlate with this behavior\n- The 3D pooling case creates the exact conditions where this fails"
