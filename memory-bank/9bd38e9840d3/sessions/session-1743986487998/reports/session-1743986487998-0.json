"HYPOTHESIS: 1. SINK Loss During Block Merging: The pm_block_merge operation is incorrectly handling SINK nodes during merging, possibly:\n- Not preserving SINK nodes when merging their containing blocks\n- Dropping SINK nodes if they're not explicitly part of the merge pattern\n- Failing to transfer SINK nodes to the merged block's output\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI analyzed the pattern matching and block merging code, focusing on how SINK nodes are handled. Key findings:\n\n1. The pattern matcher (pm_block_merge) uses a template-based approach to identify and merge blocks. When examining the implementation, I found that:\n   - It focuses on matching specific patterns of operations\n   - It doesn't have special handling for SINK nodes\n   - The merge operation preserves only nodes that are part of the matched pattern\n\n2. In linearize.py, the block merging process:\n   - Creates new blocks based on the matched pattern\n   - Connects outputs according to the pattern matching rules\n   - Does not explicitly preserve nodes that aren't part of the pattern match\n\n3. Critical issue found: When blocks are merged, SINK nodes are lost because:\n   - They're typically not part of the merge pattern\n   - There's no mechanism to transfer \"extra\" nodes (like SINKs) to the merged block\n   - The pattern matcher focuses only on computational nodes and data flow\n\nThe root cause aligns perfectly with the hypothesis: SINK nodes are being dropped during block merging because they're not explicitly included in the merge patterns, and there's no preservation mechanism for nodes outside the pattern.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was an investigation task. However, to fix this, the pattern matcher would need to be modified to:\n1. Track SINK nodes in source blocks\n2. Include a mechanism to transfer non-pattern nodes to the merged block\n3. Preserve parent-child relationships for SINK nodes during merging\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. Direct examination of the pattern matcher code shows no SINK preservation mechanism\n2. The block merging process clearly focuses only on pattern-matched nodes\n3. There's no special handling for preserving nodes outside the merge pattern\n4. The behavior exactly matches the reported symptom of SINK nodes disappearing after merging"
