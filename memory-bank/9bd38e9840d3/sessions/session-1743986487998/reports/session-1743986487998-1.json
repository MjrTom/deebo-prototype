"HYPOTHESIS: Pattern Matcher Transformation Issue: The make_basic_blocks pattern matcher is transforming or discarding SINK nodes because:\n- SINK nodes don't match expected patterns for basic block formation\n- The pattern matcher isn't preserving terminal nodes during transformations\n- SINK nodes are being incorrectly classified or transformed during block creation\n\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the pattern matching system in linearize.py and related files, focusing on:\n1. Pattern matching rules in make_basic_blocks\n2. UOp handling and SINK node treatment\n3. Pattern transformation logic\n\nKey findings:\n1. SINK nodes are actually special terminal nodes that should be preserved by design\n2. The pattern matcher doesn't have any rules that would transform SINK nodes\n3. make_basic_blocks doesn't have patterns that match or transform terminal nodes like SINK\n4. The pattern matcher preserves nodes that don't match any patterns\n5. Terminal nodes like SINK are handled separately from regular operation nodes\n\nThe issue cannot be in the pattern matcher because:\n1. Pattern matchers only transform matched patterns, leaving unmatched nodes intact\n2. SINK nodes don't match any defined patterns in make_basic_blocks\n3. The code explicitly handles terminal nodes differently from regular computational nodes\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - the investigation showed that the pattern matcher is not responsible for losing SINK nodes.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Pattern matchers operate on specific patterns and don't modify unmatched nodes\n2. SINK nodes are terminal nodes that don't match any defined patterns\n3. The pattern matching system has explicit safeguards for preserving terminal nodes\n4. The loss of SINK nodes must be happening elsewhere in the pipeline, likely during block merging or reordering phases\n\nGiven these findings, I recommend investigating:\n1. The block merging logic (pm_block_merge)\n2. The graph rewriting phase\n3. The block reordering phase\nas these are more likely candidates for where SINK nodes are being lost."
