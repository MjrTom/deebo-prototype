"HYPOTHESIS: The root cause is in the block finalization stage where SINK nodes get misplaced during block merging\nCONFIRMED: No\nINVESTIGATION:\nAfter examining the code carefully, I found that the hypothesis is incorrect for several reasons:\n\n1. The block_finalize() function is actually the last stage that processes a block, but it's not where SINK nodes are being lost. It's simply the place where we discover they're already missing.\n\n2. The critical issue appears to be earlier in the pipeline, specifically in how basic blocks are initially formed and transformed. The assert in block_finalize() is just catching a problem that occurred upstream.\n\n3. Key findings:\n- The pm_block_merge function doesn't directly handle SINK nodes - it's focused on merging block structure\n- SINK nodes should be preserved during block creation and transformation before we even get to merging\n- The pattern matching system that creates and transforms blocks appears to be the more likely culprit\n\nLooking at the error message \"No SINK found in final merged graph\", the issue manifests at block_finalize() but originates earlier where SINK nodes are either:\n1. Not being properly created in basic blocks\n2. Being dropped during graph transformations\n3. Getting disconnected from the graph during rewrites\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as the hypothesis was not confirmed.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code clearly shows block_finalize() is a validation step, not where SINK nodes are manipulated\n2. Block merging operations don't directly interact with SINK nodes - they preserve existing node relationships\n3. The error message indicates complete absence of SINK nodes, not just misplacement\n4. Pattern matching and graph transformation stages have more direct control over node creation/preservation\n\nRecommendation: Investigate the pattern matching and graph transformation stages that occur before block merging, particularly focusing on:\n- Initial basic block creation\n- Graph rewrite rules that might affect SINK nodes\n- Any transformations that modify the graph structure"
