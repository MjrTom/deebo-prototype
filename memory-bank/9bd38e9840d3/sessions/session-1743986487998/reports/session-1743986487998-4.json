"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK nodes are being lost during initial basic block formation due to empty contexts in the pattern matcher rule.\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n1. Added detailed instrumentation to track SINK nodes through the linearization process\n2. Created test case with a simple SINK node to verify behavior\n3. Monitored context and node preservation through each stage\n\nKey findings:\n1. SINK nodes are present in initial graph state\n2. During make_basic_blocks:\n   - SINK nodes are properly captured into blocks\n   - The empty context () is indeed assigned as hypothesized\n3. During block_merge:\n   - SINK blocks exist before merge\n   - Issue appears to be more complex than just empty contexts\n   - Blocks containing SINK nodes are getting filtered out during merging, even with proper contexts\n\nThe hypothesis correctly identified that empty contexts are involved, but this is only part of the problem. The actual issue appears to be a combination of:\n1. Empty contexts in initial block formation (as hypothesized)\n2. Merge rule behavior in pm_block_merge not properly handling SINK blocks\n3. Possible reachability issues since SINK nodes are terminal nodes\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added debug instrumentation in linearize.py\n2. Created test_linearize_sink.py for reproduction\nThese changes were for investigation only, not fixes.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nWhile we confirmed that empty contexts are involved, this appears to be a more complex issue involving block merging rules and reachability. The empty context is a symptom rather than the root cause - the real issue seems to be in how pm_block_merge handles blocks containing SINKs.\n\nSuggested investigation path: Examine the block merging rules in pm_block_merge to understand why SINK-containing blocks are being filtered out during the merge process."
