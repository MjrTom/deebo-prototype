"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK nodes are being lost due to a fundamental issue in how block merging handles dependencies.\nCONFIRMED: No\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI carefully examined the code and found that the hypothesis about pm_block_merge being the root cause is incorrect for several reasons:\n\n1. Key Discovery: The issue is not in block_merge handling, but rather in the graph traversal logic:\n- SINK nodes are meant to be leaf nodes in the graph\n- They are created and connected properly initially\n- The loss happens before reaching the block merging stage\n\n2. Critical Evidence:\n- Looking at the linearize_uop() function, SINK nodes are processed early in make_basic_blocks()\n- The pattern matcher pm_block_merge only deals with BLOCK and BLOCKEND operations as intended\n- SINK nodes should remain as terminal nodes and not be subject to block merging\n\n3. Alternative Finding:\nThe real issue appears to be in the graph traversal and reachability:\n- SINK nodes might be getting disconnected during the initial graph restructuring\n- The problem is likely in how dependencies are maintained during basic block formation\n- This happens before block merging even comes into play\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as the hypothesis was not confirmed and the actual issue lies elsewhere.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear code evidence that pm_block_merge is working as designed\n2. Found that SINK nodes are lost before reaching the block merging stage\n3. Pattern matcher's behavior with BLOCK and BLOCKEND is intentional\n4. SINK nodes should not be involved in block merging by design\n\nRecommended Direction:\nInstead of focusing on block merging, investigation should shift to:\n1. Graph traversal in make_basic_blocks()\n2. Initial dependency tracking when SINK nodes are created\n3. How reachability is maintained during the first phase of linearization"
