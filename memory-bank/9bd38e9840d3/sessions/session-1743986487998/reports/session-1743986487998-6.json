"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK nodes are being lost during the initial graph traversal because linearize_uop() doesn't properly maintain node reachability during transformations.\n\nCONFIRMED: No - The hypothesis is incorrect\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n1. Initial analysis showed the issue is not in initial graph traversal or dependency tracking.\n2. Key findings:\n- The SINK nodes are properly tracked in initial dependency setup\n- The children dictionary correctly maintains parent-child relationships\n- The problem occurs during block merging, not initial traversal\n\nThe issue is actually in the block merging phase, specifically:\n1. When blocks are merged, the SINK nodes aren't being explicitly preserved in the merged block\n2. The block_merge function focuses on merging computational nodes but doesn't have special handling for SINK nodes\n3. The SINK nodes aren't being lost during traversal - they're being dropped during merging\n\nKey Evidence:\n1. The initial dependency tracking is sound:\n```python\ntemp_block_ctxs: dict[UOp, list[UOp]] = {}\nchildren: dict[UOp, list[UOp]] = {}\n```\nThis correctly builds the initial graph structure.\n\n2. The transformations maintain proper node connectivity until block merging.\n\n3. The real issue is in block merging where SINKs aren't preserved as special cases.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as hypothesis was disproven - this would require a different fix focused on block merging preservation of SINK nodes.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence in code that initial traversal maintains SINK nodes\n2. Tracked SINK nodes through each transformation step\n3. Identified exact point of loss during block merging\n4. Consistent with error message \"No SINK found in final merged graph\"\n\nRecommended Direction:\nInstead of focusing on initial traversal, investigation should shift to:\n1. Block merging preservation of SINK nodes\n2. Adding explicit SINK node handling in block_merge\n3. Ensuring SINK nodes are carried through merge operations"
