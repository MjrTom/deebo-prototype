"HYPOTHESIS: The SINK nodes are being dropped during block merging because they are treated as regular operations rather than preserved as special terminal nodes.\nCONFIRMED: Yes, but with important additional nuance\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed block_merge, linearize_uop, and SINK node handling code\n- Traced the flow of SINK nodes through the block merging process\n- Examined parent-child relationship preservation\n- Verified SINK node presence in initial graphs\n\nKey findings:\n1. SINK nodes are indeed lost during block merging, but the mechanism is more complex:\n   - Parent-child relationships aren't properly maintained during merging\n   - Block structure containing SINK nodes is not preserved\n   - No special handling exists to ensure SINK nodes remain connected\n2. The issue starts in block_merge but is compounded by:\n   - Lack of type checking during node list extension\n   - No verification of terminal node preservation\n   - Loss of block context that originally contained SINK nodes\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo direct changes made - investigation phase only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- Clear evidence of SINK node loss during block merging\n- Found exact code paths where relationships are broken\n- Verified initial presence and eventual loss of SINK nodes\n- Multiple code paths confirm the hypothesis with additional context\n\nThe hypothesis is correct that SINK nodes are being dropped during merging, but the real issue is more about relationship preservation than just mixing with regular ops. The fix would need to focus on maintaining proper parent-child relationships and block structure during merging, not just separating SINK nodes from regular operations."
