"HYPOTHESIS: The issue is more fundamental than relationship preservation - it's in the initial block creation pattern for SINK nodes - specifically in their handling in make_basic_blocks and the lack of special treatment as terminal nodes.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed linearize.py and related files for SINK node handling\n- Traced the flow of SINK nodes through block creation and merging\n- Examined test cases and existing behavior\n\nKey findings:\n1. make_basic_blocks pattern is problematic because:\n   - Creates blocks with empty context ()\n   - Doesn't preserve SINK node terminal status \n   - Allows SINK nodes to be treated as regular computational blocks\n\n2. Block merging operations:\n   - No special handling for SINK nodes\n   - Can reorder or rearrange SINK nodes like any other operation\n   - No preservation of terminal status\n\n3. Missing Invariants:\n   - No mechanism to ensure SINK nodes remain terminal\n   - No context inheritance from source nodes\n   - No separation between computation and terminal blocks\n\nThe hypothesis is correct because:\n1. The empty context in BasicBlock((), (x,)) is causing loss of critical relationship information\n2. The lack of special handling in block creation allows SINK nodes to be transformed inappropriately\n3. There's no mechanism to maintain terminal status through transformations\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Investigation only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n\nConfidence explanation:\n- Clear evidence in code structure\n- Consistent with reported symptoms of SINK node loss\n- Matches observed behavior in block merging\n- Explains why SINK nodes are lost in final merged graph\n- Can directly trace the issue to the identified pattern"
