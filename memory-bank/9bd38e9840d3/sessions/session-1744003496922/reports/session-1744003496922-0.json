"HYPOTHESIS: The error is likely occurring because we're trying to access the shape attribute of a tensor or array object that is None/null. This could happen if:\n1. A function parameter that should contain a tensor is being passed as None\n2. A tensor creation or transformation operation is failing silently and returning None\n3. There's an unhandled edge case where a tensor operation returns None instead of a valid tensor\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined linearize.py and related test files\n- Searched for shape attribute accesses throughout the codebase\n- Analyzed tensor creation and transformation operations\n- Looked for error handling and None checks\n\nKey findings:\n1. The shape attribute is frequently accessed without None checks in linearize.py\n2. There are several tensor transformation operations that could potentially return None\n3. The error occurs in shape handling code, suggesting a tensor operation returned None unexpectedly\n4. The lack of defensive programming (proper None checks) makes the code vulnerable to this type of error\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Investigation phase only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The error message explicitly indicates a None/undefined value when trying to access .shape\n- The code shows multiple places where tensor operations could return None without proper checks\n- The pattern matches typical Python TypeError behavior when attempting to access attributes on None\n- The linearize.py file contains multiple tensor transformations that could potentially fail silently\n\nThe investigation confirms our hypothesis about accessing shape on a None value. The root cause appears to be inadequate null checking in tensor operations, allowing None to propagate until it hits a shape access. This matches exactly with our initial hypothesis, particularly points 2 and 3 about tensor operations failing silently or having unhandled edge cases."
