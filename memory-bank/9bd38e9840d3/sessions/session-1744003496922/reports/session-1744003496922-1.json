"HYPOTHESIS: The error appears to be in shape handling code within linearize.py due to incorrect handling of optional tensor arguments.\n\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n1. Examined linearize.py and found several areas where shape attributes are accessed:\n   - In the ShapeTracker class\n   - In various tensor operation functions\n   - In linearize() and process() functions\n\n2. Key findings:\n   - The error isn't simply about optional arguments, but rather about the ShapeTracker's interaction with tensor operations\n   - The shape property is accessed in multiple contexts, particularly during operation processing\n   - There's insufficient validation before accessing shape attributes in some code paths\n   - The problem appears more structural than just missing optional argument handling\n\n3. The hypothesis was partially correct about shape handling being the issue, but the root cause seems more complex:\n   - It's not just about optional tensor arguments\n   - The shape property access issue occurs in the core linearization logic\n   - The error likely happens during operation processing where shape tracking fails\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this investigation was focused on validation.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\n\nReasoning for confidence level:\n- Strong evidence that shape handling is involved\n- Identified multiple potential failure points\n- Haven't seen the exact stack trace to pinpoint the precise location\n- The problem appears more complex than initially hypothesized\n\nThe hypothesis needs refinement to account for:\n1. ShapeTracker's role in the error\n2. Operation processing sequence\n3. Validation points in the linearization process"
