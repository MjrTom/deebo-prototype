Error: Race condition in task cache management

I'll start investigating this race condition in the task cache management. Let me first check the current context and then form initial hypotheses.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Without waiting for the full file contents, I can already form some initial hypotheses based on the error description:

<hypothesis>H1: Asynchronous Cache Write/Delete Conflict</hypothesis>
The error suggests that setCachedTasks() is being called asynchronously with .catch() but not awaited, while invalidateTaskCache might be running concurrently. This could cause:
- Cache being set after it was supposed to be invalidated
- Stale data being written after fresh data
- Cache entries existing when they should have been cleared

<hypothesis>H2: Missing Cache Lock Mechanism</hypothesis>
The caching system might lack a proper locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous cache operations, leading to:
- Multiple simultaneous writes
- Writes occurring during invalidation
- Race between read and invalidate operations

Let me check for any existing cache management patterns in the code:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "**/cache*.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for the search results, I'll examine if previous debugging attempts were logged:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

I have two immediate suggestions to explore based on my hypotheses:

1. For H1: Convert the cache operation to properly awaited async/await:
```typescript
await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);
return paginatedResponse;
```

2. For H2: Implement a simple cache lock:
```typescript
const lockKey = `lock:${cacheKey}`;
try {
  await acquireLock(lockKey);
  await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);
} finally {
  await releaseLock(lockKey);
}
return paginatedResponse;
```

Let me continue analyzing the file contents when they arrive to refine these hypotheses and generate more specific solutions.
