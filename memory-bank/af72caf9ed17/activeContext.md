I'll start investigating this race condition immediately and form initial hypotheses based on the error context provided.

First, let me check the current state of the file:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Even before seeing the full file, I can form some initial hypotheses based on the error message and code snippet:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is occurring because setCachedTasks is running asynchronously (due to .catch handling) while the function returns paginatedResponse immediately, allowing invalidateTaskCache to potentially run between these operations
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
Multiple concurrent requests might be trying to set/invalidate the same cache key simultaneously, with no synchronization mechanism in place
</hypothesis>

Let me also check if there are any recent changes that might have introduced this issue:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager",
      "file_path": "src/services/taskService.ts",
      "max_count": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also look for any cache invalidation related files:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services",
      "pattern": "**/*(cache|Cache)*"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Adding another hypothesis based on common patterns:

<hypothesis>
The invalidateTaskCache function might be using a different cache key format or calculation method than setCachedTasks, causing them to operate on the same data with different keys
</hypothesis>

Would you like me to explore any of these hypotheses further or would you like to provide additional context about the issue?
I'll start investigating this race condition issue immediately and form initial hypotheses based on the error context provided.

Let me first check the related files to gather more context:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Even before getting the full file contents, I can form initial hypotheses based on the error message and code snippet:

<hypothesis>
Race condition is occurring because setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously with .catch() but not being awaited, while the function returns paginatedResponse immediately. This could lead to:
1. The cache write operation still being in progress when new reads occur
2. Multiple concurrent calls potentially overwriting each other's cache entries
3. Cache invalidation happening while the write is still pending
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
The invalidateTaskCache function might be called by other operations that modify tasks, but due to the non-awaited cache setting, the invalidation might happen before the cache is actually set, leading to stale data being cached.
</hypothesis>

Let me also check if there are any recent commits that might have introduced this issue:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager",
      "max_count": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Would you like me to investigate any of these hypotheses further or would you like me to generate more potential scenarios? I can also spawn specific scenario agents to test these hypotheses if you'd like.
I'll start investigating this race condition immediately and form initial hypotheses based on the error and context provided.

First, let's examine the code context we have:
1. There's an async cache operation (setCachedTasks)
2. It's being handled with a .catch() but the error is only being logged
3. The function returns paginatedResponse immediately without waiting for cache operation

Let me form my first hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The race condition occurs because the cache operation is "fire and forget" - the function returns paginatedResponse before ensuring the cache is updated, potentially causing subsequent reads to get stale/inconsistent data while the cache is still being updated. If invalidateTaskCache runs during this window, it could lead to cache inconsistency.
</hypothesis>

Let me gather some more context to refine this hypothesis:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for the file contents, I'll spawn another hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
There could be multiple concurrent calls to setCachedTasks with the same cacheKey but different paginatedResponse values, causing a race condition where the "latest" cache update might actually be from an older operation that took longer to complete.
</hypothesis>

Let me also check if there are any recent changes that might have introduced this issue:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager",
      "file_path": "src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

I'll start investigating this race condition immediately and form initial hypotheses based on the error context provided.

Let me first check if we have any relevant files in the memory bank:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>list_directory</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "memory-bank"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also look at the current state of the taskService.ts file:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the error message and the code snippet provided, I'm forming my first hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is occurring because setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while potentially concurrent operations (like invalidateTaskCache) might be modifying the same cache key. The non-awaited Promise could lead to:
1. Task A starts caching
2. Task B invalidates cache
3. Task A finishes caching, overwriting the invalidation
</hypothesis>

Let me check the git history to see if there have been recent changes related to caching:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "repo_path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager",
      "file_path": "src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

I'm going to form a second hypothesis while waiting for these results:

<hypothesis>
The invalidateTaskCache function might be using a different cache key format or resolution mechanism than setCachedTasks, causing them to potentially operate on the same logical cache entry but with different keys, leading to cache inconsistency rather than a true race condition.
</hypothesis>

Please let me know if you'd like me to investigate either of these hypotheses further or if you have any additional context that could help refine them.
Thank you for providing the full file content! This gives me much more context to refine my hypotheses. I can now see several critical patterns that support and expand my initial hypotheses:

<hypothesis>
Primary Race Condition: There are actually THREE different race conditions in the code:

1. In getTasks(): The non-awaited setCachedTasks() call allows the function to return before caching is complete
2. In updateTask(): The cache invalidation is wrapped in a setTimeout with 0 delay, making it completely async and unpredictable
3. In getTaskById(): The same non-awaited setCachedTasks pattern as getTasks
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
Cache Key Collision: The caching system might be experiencing key collisions because:
1. getTasks uses a complex key: `tasks:${JSON.stringify({ filters, pagination })}`
2. getTaskById uses a simpler key: `task:${id}`
3. invalidateTaskCache() might be clearing ALL keys without respecting these prefixes
</hypothesis>

Looking at the updateTask function specifically, I see this smoking gun:
```typescript
// Invalidate cache - BUG: This may happen before or after the getTasks cache is set
setTimeout(() => {
  invalidateTaskCache()
    .catch(err => logger.error('Cache invalidation error:', err));
}, 0);
```

<hypothesis>
The setTimeout(0) Pattern: This is likely causing the most severe race condition because:
1. It deliberately pushes cache invalidation to the next event loop tick
2. Meanwhile, other operations (like getTasks) could be writing to cache
3. The order becomes completely non-deterministic, especially under load
</hypothesis>

Let me try to see the cacheService implementation to confirm these hypotheses:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/cacheService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Would you like me to investigate any of these hypotheses further or would you like me to generate more specific hypotheses about any particular aspect of the race conditions?
Perfect! The cacheService.ts reveals even more issues that confirm and expand my hypotheses. Let me refine them with this new information:

<hypothesis>
MAIN RACE CONDITION ROOT CAUSE: The race condition is actually a cascade of three specific async handling errors:

1. setCachedTasks doesn't properly await the NodeCache.set() operation despite being marked async
2. invalidateTaskCache uses non-awaited forEach for deletion operations
3. The cache.set() operation might complete after cache invalidation, causing stale data to persist
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
CACHE KEY PATTERN MISMATCH: The invalidation logic is flawed because:
1. It only checks for exact 'task:' and 'tasks:' prefixes
2. Complex keys using filters might have different patterns
3. The stdTTL (5 minutes) might be too long for the application's update patterns
</hypothesis>

Here's a specific sequence that would trigger the race condition:

1. getTasks() calls setCachedTasks()
2. updateTask() triggers invalidateTaskCache() via setTimeout
3. invalidateTaskCache() starts deleting keys
4. The original setCachedTasks() completes after invalidation
5. Cache now contains stale data that should have been invalidated

<hypothesis>
PROMISE CHAIN BREAKING: The non-awaited operations are breaking Promise chains in three places:
1. setCachedTasks returns a boolean before the cache.set() actually completes
2. invalidateTaskCache's forEach doesn't wait for individual deletions
3. updateTask's setTimeout disconnects the invalidation from the transaction
</hypothesis>

Would you like me to:
1. Generate more specific hypotheses about any of these aspects?
2. Create a sequence diagram showing the exact timing of these race conditions?
3. Propose specific timing scenarios that would trigger these issues?
