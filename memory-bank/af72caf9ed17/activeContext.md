Error: Race condition in task cache management

Okay, the active context is empty. We're starting fresh on this one.

The error points to a race condition in `/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts` involving `setCachedTasks` and `invalidateTaskCache`. The problematic code is:

```typescript
// Cache the result - BUG: This is causing a race condition with invalidateTaskCache
setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)
  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));

return paginatedResponse;
```

The `setCachedTasks` call is asynchronous (indicated by `.catch`) and isn't awaited. This means the function returns `paginatedResponse` *before* the cache is potentially updated. If `invalidateTaskCache` is called shortly after this function returns, but before `setCachedTasks` completes its asynchronous operation, the invalidation might happen first, only to be overwritten by the stale data being cached by the `setCachedTasks` operation.

<hypothesis>The race condition happens because `setCachedTasks` is not awaited. An `invalidateTaskCache` call triggered by a concurrent operation (e.g., task update/delete) can execute *after* the data fetch but *before* the asynchronous `setCachedTasks` completes, leading to the stale data overwriting the cache invalidation.</hypothesis>

To confirm this, I need to understand how `setCachedTasks` and `invalidateTaskCache` work and where else they are used. Let's examine the relevant file.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"

Error: Race condition in task cache management

Okay, the scenario agent (session-1744196747159-0) confirms our initial hypothesis. Excellent work, little one!

**Summary of Findings:**

1.  **Race Condition Confirmed:** The root cause is indeed the non-awaited `setCachedTasks` calls in `getTasks` and `getTaskById`, combined with potentially concurrent `invalidateTaskCache` calls (especially the non-awaited one in `updateTask`).
2.  **Mechanism:** A `getTasks` call can start fetching data. Before its `setCachedTasks` promise resolves, an `updateTask` (or `deleteTask`/`createTask`) can trigger `invalidateTaskCache`. If `invalidateTaskCache` runs *after* `getTasks` returns but *before* `setCachedTasks` finishes writing, the stale data from `getTasks` overwrites the cache *after* it was supposed to be invalidated. The un-awaited `invalidateTaskCache` in `updateTask` makes this timing even more unpredictable.
3.  **Affected Functions:**
    *   `getTasks`: `setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);` (needs `await`)
    *   `getTaskById`: `setCachedTasks(cacheKey, task as Task);` (needs `await`)
    *   `updateTask`: `invalidateTaskCache();` (needs `await`)

**Proposed Solution:**

The most direct solution is to ensure these cache operations complete in the intended order by using `await`.

1.  Add `await` before `setCachedTasks` in `getTasks`.
2.  Add `await` before `setCachedTasks` in `getTaskById`.
3.  Add `await` before `invalidateTaskCache` in `updateTask`.

Let's refine the hypothesis slightly to encompass all identified locations.

<hypothesis>The race condition stems from un-awaited asynchronous cache operations (`setCachedTasks` in `getTasks` and `getTaskById`, and `invalidateTaskCache` in `updateTask`), allowing cache writes to complete after invalidations, resulting in stale cache entries. Awaiting these operations should enforce correct sequencing and resolve the race condition.</hypothesis>

Before I commit to a full solution tag, let's spawn a scenario agent to apply these specific changes and verify the fix. I'll update the notes first.

Now, let's create a scenario to apply the fix.

```tool_code
<create_mcp_scenario>
  <branch_name>fix/task-cache-race-condition-awaits</branch_name>
  <remote_name>origin</remote_name>
  <base_branch>main</base_branch>
  <repo_path>/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager</repo_path>
  <hypothesis>Adding 'await' to setCachedTasks calls in getTasks/getTaskById and invalidateTaskCache call in updateTask will fix the race condition.</hypothesis>
  <instructions>
1. Read the file `/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts`.
2. Apply the following changes using `edit_file`:
    - In `getTasks`, change `setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);` to `await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);`. Remember to handle the `.catch` appropriately or remove it if the error should bubble up (prefer bubbling up for now). Let's remove the `.catch` for simplicity and let errors propagate.
    - In `getTaskById`, change `setCachedTasks(cacheKey, task as Task);` to `await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, task as Task);`. Remove the `.catch` if present.
    - In `updateTask`, change `invalidateTaskCache();` to `await invalidateTaskCache();`.
3. Run any relevant tests (e.g., `npm test` or specific test files related to task service/caching if they exist) to verify the fix doesn't break anything and ideally confirm the race condition is gone (though this might require specific stress tests). If no tests exist, state that.
4. If tests pass (or none exist), report success. If tests fail, report the failure details.
  </instructions>
  <context>
Based on the analysis, the race condition is caused by fire-and-forget async calls related to caching. Specifically:
- `setCachedTasks` in `getTasks`
- `setCachedTasks` in `getTaskById`
- `invalidateTaskCache` in `updateTask`
The proposed fix is to add `await` to these three calls. The previous scenario (session-1744196747159-0) confirmed this diagnosis via logging/simulation. Your task is to implement and test this fix. Be mindful of removing the `.catch` attached to the original `setCachedTasks` in `getTasks` as awaiting will naturally propagate errors.

Error: Race condition in task cache management

Let me start investigating this race condition issue. First, I'll check the memory bank files to see what we know so far.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the error message and the code snippet provided, I can already form an initial hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is likely occurring because setCachedTasks is running asynchronously (.catch indicates a Promise) while the function immediately returns paginatedResponse. If invalidateTaskCache is called during this window, it could clear the cache right after setCachedTasks completes but before the cache is actually needed again, leading to inconsistent state.
</hypothesis>

Let me examine the actual task service code to validate this:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for that, I'll form a second hypothesis as a backup:

<hypothesis>
If setCachedTasks and invalidateTaskCache are using different cache key generation methods or timing, there could be a race where invalidateTaskCache clears a cache entry right before setCachedTasks tries to write to it, causing subsequent cache misses and potential data inconsistency.
</hypothesis>

Please share any additional context about when this race condition is most commonly observed. Does it happen under specific conditions like high load or particular API patterns?
