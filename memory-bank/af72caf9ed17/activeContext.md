Error: Race condition in task cache management

I'll start investigating this race condition issue in the task cache management. Let me first check the current state of the taskService.ts file and review any existing debugging context.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also check if there's any relevant debugging history:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the initial error description, I'll form my first hypothesis while waiting for the file contents:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is likely occurring because multiple async operations are trying to modify the task cache simultaneously without proper synchronization. Specifically:
1. The code might be making parallel API calls for pagination
2. Each API response tries to update the cache immediately
3. There's no mutex or queue system to ensure sequential cache updates
This could lead to later pages overwriting earlier pages or partial cache updates.
</hypothesis>

Let me analyze the file contents when they come through to refine or revise this hypothesis and propose specific solutions.

Error: Race condition in task cache management

Let me start investigating this race condition issue in the task cache management. First, I'll check the memory bank context and then form initial hypotheses.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also look at the current code context:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services",
      "pattern": "setCachedTasks|invalidateTaskCache",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 10,
      "ignoreCase": false
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the error message and initial context, I can form some initial hypotheses:

<hypothesis>The race condition occurs because setCachedTasks() is being called asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while invalidateTaskCache might be called immediately after in a different execution context. This could lead to:

1. setCachedTasks starts running
2. invalidateTaskCache runs before setCachedTasks completes
3. setCachedTasks finally completes, potentially overwriting the invalidated cache with stale data
</hypothesis>

Let me examine the implementation of both functions to validate this hypothesis:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services",
      "pattern": "class.*TaskService|interface.*TaskService",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 15,
      "ignoreCase": false
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

To properly debug this, I'll also need to see the task cache implementation:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "cache",
      "file_pattern": "*.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me form a second hypothesis based on the error handling approach:

<hypothesis>The error handling with .catch() could be masking cache consistency issues:

1. If setCachedTasks fails silently (only logged)
2. The function returns paginatedResponse anyway
3. This creates a disconnect between what's in the cache and what was returned
4. Next cache read could get stale/invalid data because error wasn't propagated properly
</hypothesis>

To properly investigate and suggest a fix, I need to see:
1. How invalidateTaskCache is typically called
2. The full cache implementation
3. The surrounding code that uses these cache operations

Could you provide:
1. The implementation of invalidateTaskCache
2. The code that triggers these cache operations
3. The full TaskService class implementation

This will help me confirm which hypothesis is correct and propose the most appropriate solution.

Error: Race condition in task cache management

I'll start investigating this race condition issue in the task cache management. Let me first check the current context and then form initial hypotheses.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

While waiting for the file content, I can already form an initial hypothesis based on the error message and code snippet:

<hypothesis>
The race condition likely occurs because setCachedTasks is running asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while invalidateTaskCache could be called immediately after in a different operation. This creates a potential scenario where:
1. Operation A starts setting cache
2. Operation B invalidates cache
3. Operation A finishes setting cache with now-stale data
</hypothesis>

Let me check if this has been investigated before:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also search for any invalidateTaskCache references to understand the other side of this race condition:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "invalidateTaskCache",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on this initial code context, I'll form a second hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The issue could be compounded by multiple cache operations sharing the same cacheKey. If different operations (like list, update, delete) use the same key pattern, they could be interfering with each other's cache states. The lack of awaiting setCachedTasks means we have no guarantees about cache state consistency.
</hypothesis>

Please share if you have any specific scenarios where this race condition is most commonly observed, or if you'd like me to investigate any particular aspects of these hypotheses first.

Also, I suspect the immediate solution might involve:
1. Making the cache operation synchronous by awaiting setCachedTasks
2. Implementing a cache lock mechanism
3. Using atomic cache operations

Would you like me to explore any of these potential solutions in detail?

Error: Race condition in task cache management

Let me start by checking the memory bank to see any previous debugging context and then form initial hypotheses about this race condition.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also look at the task service file to understand the caching logic better:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
  }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the initial error message and the code snippet shown, I can already form some initial hypotheses:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is likely occurring because setCachedTasks() is being called asynchronously with .catch() but the function returns immediately without awaiting the cache operation. This means:

1. The cache write operation is "fire and forget"
2. If invalidateTaskCache() is called shortly after, it could clear the cache while the write is still pending
3. This creates an inconsistent state where newer data might be overwritten by stale data from the pending cache write
</hypothesis>

To validate this hypothesis, I need to:

1. Look for where invalidateTaskCache is being called
2. Check if there are any timing-dependent operations that could trigger this race

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "invalidateTaskCache",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also see if there are other cache-related operations that might be involved:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "setCachedTasks",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on what I've seen, I'll generate another hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The root cause may be deeper than just the async cache write. The caching system appears to lack proper synchronization mechanisms:

1. There's no atomic "check-then-set" operation for the cache
2. Multiple concurrent requests could be racing to update the same cache key
3. The cache invalidation might not properly coordinate with ongoing cache writes
</hypothesis>

To progress this investigation, I need to:
1. Examine how the cache key is generated
2. Look at the actual implementation of setCachedTasks
3. Understand the full flow of when/how invalidateTaskCache is triggered

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "cacheKey",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Would you like me to continue investigating these hypotheses, or would you like me to focus on one of them specifically? I can start proposing solutions once we validate which hypothesis is correct.

Based on the error description and the code snippet shown, I can already form some initial hypotheses:

<hypothesis>The race condition is occurring because the setCachedTasks operation is being called asynchronously (.catch shows it's a Promise) but the function returns immediately without waiting for the cache operation to complete. If invalidateTaskCache is called during this window, it could clear the cache while the set operation is still pending, leading to inconsistent cache state.</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>The cache invalidation and cache setting operations may be happening in parallel across different requests/operations, with no synchronization mechanism to ensure proper ordering of these operations.</hypothesis>

To validate these hypotheses, I need to:

1. Check how invalidateTaskCache is implemented
2. Look for any parallel operations that might trigger cache updates/invalidations
3. Examine the overall cache management architecture

Let me search for the invalidateTaskCache implementation:

<use_mcp_tool>

</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the error message and the code snippet, I can already form some initial hypotheses:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is occurring because setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while invalidateTaskCache might be called concurrently. This could lead to:
1. A stale cache being written after a cache invalidation
2. Cache inconsistency if multiple tasks are being updated simultaneously
</hypothesis>

<hypothesis>
The unhandled promise from .catch() could be causing timing issues where errors in cache setting are not properly propagated, leading to inconsistent state between the actual data and cached data
</hypothesis>

Let me verify this by checking how invalidateTaskCache is implemented and where it's called.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>

      "contextLines": 5,
      "ignoreCase": false
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

I'd like to generate a more specific hypothesis based on what I've seen:

<hypothesis>
The core issue is likely in the execution order and promise handling:

1. The current code returns paginatedResponse immediately without awaiting setCachedTasks
2. This means that subsequent operations (including possible cache invalidations) can occur before the cache is actually set
3. If invalidateTaskCache is called right after this function returns but before setCachedTasks completes, we could end up with:
   - Cache being invalidated
   - Old data being written to cache after invalidation
   - Resulting in stale data persisting in cache
</hypothesis>

To properly investigate this, I need to:
1. See how the cache key is generated
2. Check the implementation of both setCachedTasks and invalidateTaskCache
3. Look at the call patterns to understand the concurrency scenarios

Would you like me to continue investigating any of these specific aspects, or should I propose a potential solution based on my current hypothesis?

Error: Race condition in task cache management

Okay, I've reviewed the `activeContext.md`. It seems this race condition has been looked at before, and the recurring hypothesis is that `setCachedTasks` is not being `await`ed, causing a "fire-and-forget" situation where it might complete *after* an `invalidateTaskCache` call, leading to stale data being written back.

Let's confirm this by examining the code. I need to see the context around the problematic line, the implementation of `setCachedTasks`, and how `invalidateTaskCache` is used.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>desktop-commander</server_name>
  <tool_name>search_code</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src",
      "pattern": "invalidateTaskCache",
      "filePattern": "*.ts",
      "contextLines": 5
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the provided snippet and the history in `activeContext.md`, here's my primary hypothesis:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is caused by the `setCachedTasks` promise not being awaited before the function returns `paginatedResponse`. This allows subsequent operations, potentially including `invalidateTaskCache` (e.g., triggered by a task update or deletion shortly after a fetch), to execute before the cache write completes. If `invalidateTaskCache` runs and clears the relevant cache entries, the still-pending `setCachedTasks` operation will then write stale data back into the cache upon its eventual completion. The `.catch()` only logs the error but doesn't prevent the function from returning prematurely.
</hypothesis>

I'll analyze the file content and search results when they arrive to confirm this and propose a specific fix, likely involving adding `await` to the `setCachedTasks` call.
