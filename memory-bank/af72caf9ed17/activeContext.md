Error: Race condition in task cache management

I'll start investigating this race condition issue in the task cache management. Let me first check the current state of the taskService.ts file and review any existing debugging context.

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Let me also check if there's any relevant debugging history:

<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "path": "/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md"
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

Based on the initial error description, I'll form my first hypothesis while waiting for the file contents:

<hypothesis>
The race condition is likely occurring because multiple async operations are trying to modify the task cache simultaneously without proper synchronization. Specifically:
1. The code might be making parallel API calls for pagination
2. Each API response tries to update the cache immediately
3. There's no mutex or queue system to ensure sequential cache updates
This could lead to later pages overwriting earlier pages or partial cache updates.
</hypothesis>

Let me analyze the file contents when they come through to refine or revise this hypothesis and propose specific solutions.
