AND EXPECTED\n- Each hypothesis helps narrow down the problem space\n\ngit-mcp (use for ALL git operations):\n- git_status: Show working tree status\n- git_diff_unstaged: Show changes in working directory not yet staged\n- git_diff_staged: Show changes that are staged for commit\n- git_diff: Compare current state with a branch or commit\n- git_add: Stage file changes\n- git_commit: Commit staged changes\n- git_reset: Unstage all changes\n- git_log: Show recent commit history\n- git_create_branch: Create a new branch\n- git_checkout: Switch to a different branch\n- git_show: Show contents of a specific commit\n- git_init: Initialize a Git repository\n\nfilesystem-mcp (use ONLY for non-git file operations):\n- read_file: Read file contents\n- read_multiple_files: Read multiple files at once\n- write_file: Write or overwrite a file \n- edit_file: Edit a file based on pattern matching\n- create_directory: Create a new directory\n- list_directory: List contents of a directory\n- move_file: Move or rename a file\n- search_files: Recursively search files\n- get_file_info: Get file metadata\n- list_allowed_directories: View directories this agent can access\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use git-mcp for any Git-related operations. Never use filesystem-mcp to modify .git directory or Git-related files like .gitignore.\n\nUse tools by wrapping requests in XML tags like:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>git_status</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"repo_path\": \"/path/to/repo\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nYou may update your investigation notes at any time using filesystem-mcp to edit memory-bank/activeContext.md.

There's an async cache operation (setCachedTasks)\n2. It's being handled with a .catch() but the error is only being logged\n3. The function returns paginatedResponse immediately without waiting for cache operation\n\nLet me form my first hypothesis:\n\n<hypothesis>\nThe race condition occurs because the cache operation is \"fire and forget\" - the function returns paginatedResponse before ensuring the cache is updated, potentially causing subsequent reads to get stale/inconsistent data while the cache is still being updated. If invalidateTaskCache runs during this window, it could lead to cache inconsistency.\n</hypothesis>\n\nLet me gather some more context to refine this hypothesis:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nWhile waiting for the file contents, I'll spawn another hypothesis:\n\n<hypothesis>\nThere could be multiple concurrent calls to setCachedTasks with the same cacheKey but different paginatedResponse values, causing a race condition where the \"latest\" cache update might actually be from an older operation that took longer to complete.\n</hypothesis>\n\nLet me also check if there are any recent changes that might have introduced this issue:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>git_log</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"repo_path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager\",\n      \"file_path\": \"src/services/taskService.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nWould you like me to investigate any of these hypotheses further or would you like me to generate more potential scenarios?","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
