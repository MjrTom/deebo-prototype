This means invalidateTaskCache() could be called before setCachedTasks() completes, leading to cache inconsistency.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe key piece of evidence is in the code snippet showing:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\nThis pattern demonstrates exactly the race condition described in the hypothesis:\n1. The code calls setCachedTasks() which returns a Promise\n2. Instead of awaiting it, it only attaches a .catch() handler\n3. The function immediately returns paginatedResponse\n4. The setCachedTasks operation continues running in the background\n\nThis creates a definite race condition because:\n- The cache setting operation is \"fire and forget\" - no coordination with other cache operations\n- No guarantee the cache set will complete before other code can call invalidateTaskCache()\n- Error handling only logs errors but doesn't prevent the race condition\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone made yet - investigation phase only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code pattern clearly shows async operation without proper awaiting\n2. The .catch() handler proves setCachedTasks is Promise-based\n3. This matches the exact pattern that commonly causes race conditions\n4. The immediate return while async operation is pending is a well-known anti-pattern\n5. This perfectly explains the observed cache inconsistency issues\n</report>\n\nThe hypothesis is strongly supported by the evidence. The race condition exists exactly as described, with the cache setting operation being executed asynchronously without proper coordination with other cache operations. The fix would likely involve properly awaiting the setCachedTasks operation before returning, but that's beyond the scope of this hypothesis validation task.","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
