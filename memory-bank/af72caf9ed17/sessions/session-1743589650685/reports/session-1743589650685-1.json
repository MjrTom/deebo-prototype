"\nHYPOTHESIS: The invalidateTaskCache function might be synchronous while setCachedTasks is asynchronous, causing a timing mismatch. If invalidateTaskCache is called immediately after this code but executes faster than setCachedTasks, it could create the following sequence:\n1. setCachedTasks starts\n2. invalidateTaskCache runs and clears cache\n3. setCachedTasks completes and writes potentially stale data to cache\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the taskService.ts and cache utilities implementation\n- Key finding: The code shows that setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously (as evidenced by the .catch handler), but the return happens immediately\n- The error message explicitly mentions a race condition with invalidateTaskCache\n- The current implementation doesn't wait for the cache operation to complete before returning\n- The asynchronous setCachedTasks operation is \"fire and forget\" style, making it vulnerable to race conditions\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as the investigation was focused on confirming the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure clearly shows the asynchronous vs synchronous mismatch\n2. The error pattern matches exactly with the hypothesis\n3. The \"fire and forget\" pattern with setCachedTasks makes it impossible to guarantee cache consistency\n4. The explicit error message about race conditions with invalidateTaskCache corroborates the hypothesis\n\nThe issue is exactly as hypothesized: setCachedTasks is asynchronous and runs independently after the response is returned, while invalidateTaskCache can run at any time. This creates a race condition where the cache invalidation and cache setting can happen in any order, potentially leaving stale data in the cache.\n"
