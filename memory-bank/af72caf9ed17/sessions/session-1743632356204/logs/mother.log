Your core mission:\n\n1. INVESTIGATE and HYPOTHESIZE aggressively\n2. Don't wait for perfect information\n3. Generate hypotheses even if you're uncertain\n\nKEY DIRECTIVES:\n- Always generate at least one hypothesis within your first 2-3 responses\n- Use <hypothesis>Your hypothesis here</hypothesis> liberally\n- Better to spawn 5 wrong scenario agents than miss the right one\n- If you see an error message, immediately form hypotheses about its causes\n- Don't wait for full context - start with what you have\n- AVOID REDUNDANT HYPOTHESES - read scenario reports to learn what's been tried\n- Pass what failed to scenarios via context argument so they don't waste time\n\nMEMORY BANK INVESTIGATION AIDS:\nThe memory bank at /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17 contains two key files to help your investigation:\n\n1. activeContext.md - Your live investigation notebook:\n- READ THIS FIRST when starting an investigation using /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md\n- Contains your previous debugging notes and observations\n- Shows which approaches were promising vs dead ends\n- Records important error patterns you've noticed\n- Use this to avoid repeating failed approaches\n- Read this to understand which parts of the code were already examined\n- To edit, use read_file to get the latest state, then write a targeted diff using edit_file instead of write_file to avoid overwriting\n\n2. progress.md - The full debugging history (access at /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/progress.md):\n- Contains complete records of all debug sessions\n- Shows which hypotheses were tried and their outcomes\n- Lists all scenarios that were run and their results\n- Use this to see if similar bugs were fixed before\n\nUse these files to:\n- Build on previous investigation progress\n- Spot patterns in failing scenarios\n- Generate better hypotheses based on what's worked/failed\n- Provide relevant context to scenario agents\n- Track the evolution of your debugging approach\n- Take notes! You're a scientist mother (think Dr. Akagi), not a robot. Be creative and curious.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17 as the absolute path for memory bank files.

This can lead to:\n1. A stale cache being written after a newer invalidation\n2. Cache inconsistency if the write fails but the response is still returned\n3. Potential data corruption if multiple cache operations happen simultaneously\n</hypothesis>\n\nLet me gather more information about the caching implementation:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src\",\n      \"pattern\": \"**/cache*.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>git-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>git_diff</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"repo_path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager\",\n      \"target\": \"HEAD\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nThis will help me understand:\n1. The caching implementation details\n2. Recent changes that might have introduced the race condition\n3. Where invalidateTaskCache is being called\n\nI'll generate more specific hypotheses once I see these results, but the core issue appears to be async cache management without proper synchronization.","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
