"HYPOTHESIS: The caching system may be using a shared cache store (like Redis or in-memory cache) without proper locking mechanisms, leading to race conditions between cache writes and invalidations.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nContext examined:\n- Full taskService.ts implementation\n- Recent commit history showing cache-related changes\n- Cache operation implementations and patterns\n\nKey findings:\n1. The code uses asynchronous cache operations incorrectly:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);  // async operation with no await\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. The commit history reveals critical information:\n- Previous attempt to fix by removing async/await (c4c6b96)\n- Subsequent attempt to add cache versioning (28667f95)\n\n3. Race condition specifically occurs between:\n- getTasks() setting cache\n- updateTask() invalidating cache\n- Both operations being non-atomic and asynchronous\n\n4. The hypothesis is precisely confirmed by the code pattern and commit history showing:\n- Shared cache store being used\n- No locking mechanisms\n- Async operations without proper synchronization\n- Exactly the race condition pattern described in hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons:\n1. The code explicitly shows the race condition pattern\n2. Commit history shows previous attempts to fix this exact issue\n3. The bug comment specifically identifies it as a race condition\n4. The async operation pattern matches exactly with the hypothesis scenario\n5. Previous fixes (removing async/await, adding versioning) indicate this is indeed a distributed cache synchronization issue\n\nThe investigation conclusively proves that this is exactly the race condition scenario described in the hypothesis, where Instance A's cache write can overwrite Instance B's cache invalidation due to lack of proper synchronization mechanisms in a shared cache store."
