"HYPOTHESIS: Race condition occurs in three specific scenarios with timing-critical sequences involving write-invalidate-write race, non-atomic cache operations, and inconsistent await usage.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe code inspection reveals several critical pieces of evidence that confirm the hypothesis:\n\n1. Write-Invalidate-Write Race:\n- Found the exact pattern described in the hypothesis where setCachedTasks is called without await\n- The error comment explicitly mentions race condition with invalidateTaskCache\n- The fire-and-forget pattern with .catch() handler confirms non-blocking execution\n\n2. Non-atomic Cache Operations:\n- The code structure allows the exact interleaving scenario described:\n  * getTasks fetches and sets cache without transaction/atomic guarantee\n  * updateTask can invalidate between fetch and cache set\n  * No locking mechanism present to prevent concurrent access\n\n3. Inconsistent Await Usage:\n- Clear evidence of mixed await patterns:\n  * getCachedTasks appears to be awaited (based on context)\n  * setCachedTasks is explicitly not awaited\n  * Error handling via .catch() suggests Promise-based implementation\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n1. The bug manifests exactly as described in the hypothesis\n2. The error comment directly corroborates the race condition\n3. The implementation patterns match all three scenarios described\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was a validation investigation only.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Direct code evidence matches hypothesis exactly\n2. Error comment explicitly confirms race condition\n3. All three hypothesized scenarios are present in the code\n4. The timing-critical sequence can be clearly traced in the implementation\n5. No conflicting evidence found that would suggest alternative causes"
