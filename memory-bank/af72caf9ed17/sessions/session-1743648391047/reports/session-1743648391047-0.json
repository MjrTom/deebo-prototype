"HYPOTHESIS: Primary Hypothesis 1: Unhandled Promise Race\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the task service code and cache-related files\n- Identified asynchronous cache operation running in parallel with response return\n- Found that cache setting operation was fire-and-forget style\n- Confirmed race condition between cache setting and invalidation\n- The core issue was returning the response before ensuring cache operation completed\n\nKey findings:\n1. Cache setting was not properly awaited\n2. Error handling was detached from the main flow\n3. Race condition could occur between setting and invalidation\n4. No guarantee of cache state consistency\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Modified taskService.ts to properly await cache setting\n2. Added proper error handling while preserving the response flow\n3. Ensured cache operation completes before proceeding\n4. Maintained fallback to return response even if cache fails\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence clearly shows this was an unhandled Promise race condition:\n- Async operation (setCachedTasks) not being awaited\n- Return statement executing before cache operation completes\n- Error handling that doesn't affect the main flow\n- The fix ensures proper Promise handling while maintaining functionality"
