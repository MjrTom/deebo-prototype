"HYPOTHESIS: Cache Key Collision\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the cache implementation and task service code\n- Found that the race condition occurs between setCachedTasks and invalidateTaskCache\n- The key insight is the async nature of setCachedTasks combined with immediate return\n- The cache key construction appears to be causing collisions due to:\n  1. Async operations not waiting for cache updates\n  2. Multiple requests potentially generating the same cache key\n  3. Non-atomic cache operations\n\nKey findings:\n1. The setCachedTasks operation is fire-and-forget (not awaited)\n2. The cache key might not be unique enough for concurrent requests\n3. Return happens before cache is actually set, allowing race conditions\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this is a validation task, but recommended changes would be:\n1. Make cache keys more unique by including request-specific identifiers\n2. Implement atomic cache operations\n3. Properly await cache operations\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning:\n1. Clear evidence in the code pattern showing non-atomic cache operations\n2. The race condition perfectly aligns with cache key collision behavior\n3. The error pattern matches what would be expected from cache key collisions\n4. The fire-and-forget cache setting pattern is a known anti-pattern that leads to this issue"
