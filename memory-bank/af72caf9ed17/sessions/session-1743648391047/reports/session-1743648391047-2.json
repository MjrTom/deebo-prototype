"HYPOTHESIS: Hypothesis 3: Async Cleanup Timing\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe code shows a clear async timing issue where setCachedTasks is called asynchronously but not awaited, while the response is immediately returned. This creates a race condition with invalidateTaskCache.\n\nKey findings:\n1. The cache setting operation is fire-and-forget (not awaited)\n2. Any error in cache setting is only logged, not handled\n3. There's no synchronization between cache updates and invalidations\n4. The immediate return of paginatedResponse means cache state could be inconsistent\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed because this is explicitly an async timing issue where the cleanup (invalidation) can race with the cache setting operation.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nProposed fix for taskService.ts:\n```typescript\n// Before:\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n\n// After:\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\nThis change ensures that:\n1. Cache operation completes before response is returned\n2. Any race condition with invalidateTaskCache is prevented\n3. Cache errors can be properly handled\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code pattern is a well-known anti-pattern for race conditions\n2. The bug matches exactly with the async timing hypothesis\n3. The fix follows established patterns for handling async operations\n4. The original code's comment explicitly identifies this as a race condition"
