"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition occurs because setCachedTasks is asynchronous but non-blocking (due to .catch handling), allowing the function to return paginatedResponse before the cache is actually set. If invalidateTaskCache runs in this window, it could clear a cache that hasn't been properly set yet.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Analyzed the code structure and Promise chain handling\n- Added timing diagnostics to verify the sequence of operations\n- Identified that the function returns immediately without awaiting cache completion\n- Confirmed that invalidateTaskCache could run in the window between return and cache completion\n\nKey findings:\n1. The setCachedTasks operation is properly async but improperly handled\n2. The .catch() handler creates a \"fire-and-forget\" situation\n3. There's a clear timing window where cache state is inconsistent\n4. The return happens before cache operation completes\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Added console.time() tracking to verify timing\n- Added completion logging to confirm operation sequence\nThese changes were for diagnostic purposes to verify the hypothesis\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code structure clearly shows the race condition\n2. The timing window is demonstrable through logging\n3. The async operation is definitively non-blocking due to lack of await\n4. The problem matches classic race condition patterns with async operations\n\nThe fix would involve properly awaiting the cache operation, but that wasn't part of this hypothesis validation scope."
