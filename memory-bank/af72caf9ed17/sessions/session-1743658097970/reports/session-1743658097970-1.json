"HYPOTHESIS: H2: Multiple concurrent requests might be trying to set/invalidate the cache simultaneously, leading to inconsistent cache states since there's no synchronization mechanism.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the taskService.ts file which shows asynchronous cache operations\n- Key problematic pattern identified: non-awaited setCachedTasks running concurrently with invalidateTaskCache\n- The cache setting operation is fire-and-forget, allowing the response to be returned before cache is actually set\n- No synchronization mechanism exists between cache setting and invalidation\n\nKey findings:\n1. The cache set operation is asynchronous but not properly awaited\n2. There's no mutual exclusion mechanism between set and invalidate operations\n3. The comment explicitly acknowledges a race condition with invalidateTaskCache\n4. The error handling (.catch) suggests cache operations can fail silently while the main flow continues\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n- Multiple requests can indeed interfere with each other's cache operations\n- Cache invalidation can occur while a set operation is in progress\n- No locking or synchronization mechanism prevents concurrent modifications\n- The asynchronous nature of operations without proper waiting creates a clear race condition\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes implemented as the focus was on hypothesis validation.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence in code structure showing async operations without synchronization\n2. Explicit acknowledgment in code comments about the race condition\n3. The pattern matches classic race condition scenarios in cache management\n4. The fire-and-forget cache setting pattern is a well-known cause of cache inconsistencies"
