Your core mission:\n\n1. INVESTIGATE and HYPOTHESIZE aggressively\n2. Don't wait for perfect information\n3. Generate hypotheses even if you're uncertain\nWhen you've found a solution or determined none exists, wrap it in solution tags:\n<solution>Your final conclusion and solution here</solution>\nKEY DIRECTIVES:\n- Always generate at least one hypothesis within your first 2-3 responses\n- Use <hypothesis>Your hypothesis here</hypothesis> liberally\n- Better to spawn 5 wrong scenario agents than miss the right one\n- If you see an error message, immediately form hypotheses about its causes\n- Don't wait for full context - start with what you have\n- AVOID REDUNDANT HYPOTHESES - read scenario reports to learn what's been tried\n- Pass what failed to scenarios via context argument so they don't waste time\n\nMEMORY BANK INVESTIGATION AIDS:\nThe memory bank at /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17 contains two key files to help your investigation:\n\n1. activeContext.md - Your live investigation notebook:\n- READ THIS FIRST when starting an investigation using /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md\n- Contains your previous debugging notes and observations\n- Shows which approaches were promising vs dead ends\n- Records important error patterns you've noticed\n- Use this to avoid repeating failed approaches\n- Read this to understand which parts of the code were already examined\n- To edit, use read_file to get the latest state, then write a targeted diff using edit_file instead of write_file to avoid overwriting\n\n2. progress.md - The full debugging history (access at /Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/progress.md):\n- Contains complete records of all debug sessions\n- Shows which hypotheses were tried and their outcomes\n- Lists all scenarios that were run and their results\n- Use this to see if similar bugs were fixed before\n\nUse these files to:\n- Build on previous investigation progress\n- Spot patterns in failing scenarios\n- Generate better hypotheses based on what's worked/failed\n- Provide relevant context to scenario agents\n- Track the evolution of your debugging approach\n- Take notes! You're a scientist mother (think Dr. Akagi), not a robot.

Let me first check the memory bank for any previous debugging context and then form initial hypotheses.\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/Cline/MCP/deebo-prototype/memory-bank/af72caf9ed17/activeContext.md\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nLet me also look at the task service file:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>read_file</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nBased on the error message and the code snippet provided, I can already form some initial hypotheses:\n\n<hypothesis>\nThe race condition is likely occurring because setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously with .catch() but not being awaited, while the function returns immediately. This means invalidateTaskCache could be called before setCachedTasks completes, leading to inconsistent cache state.\n</hypothesis>\n\n<hypothesis>\nThe cacheKey might not be unique enough or might be shared across different operations, causing concurrent write/invalidate operations to interfere with each other.\n</hypothesis>\n\nLet me check for any related cache invalidation code:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src\",\n      \"pattern\": \"invalidateTaskCache\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nThis is a classic concurrency issue pattern. Without waiting for more info, I can propose an initial solution:\n\n<solution>\nThe immediate fix should be to properly await the cache operation:\n\n```typescript\n// Change from:\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n\n// To:\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => {\n    logger.error('Cache setting error:', err);\n    // Optionally throw error if cache is critical\n  });\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\nThis ensures that:\n1. The cache operation completes before returning\n2. Any invalidation operations will happen in the correct order\n3. We maintain cache consistency\n\nAdditional recommendations:\n- Consider adding a mutex/lock mechanism for cache operations\n- Add version/timestamp to cache entries to detect stale data\n- Consider using a distributed cache solution if running in a multi-node environment\n</solution>\n\nThe core issue is that the current implementation creates a \"fire-and-forget\" cache operation that can race with cache invalidation. By properly awaiting the cache operation, we ensure proper sequencing of operations.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Generate more specific hypotheses about the invalidation mechanism?\n2. Investigate the cacheKey generation?\n3. Look into potential distributed system aspects of this issue?","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
