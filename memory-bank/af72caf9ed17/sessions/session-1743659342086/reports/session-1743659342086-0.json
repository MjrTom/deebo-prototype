"HYPOTHESIS: H1: Asynchronous Cache Write/Delete Conflict\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe code exhibits a clear race condition pattern where cache writes and invalidations can conflict due to:\n1. Non-awaited cache write operation (fire-and-forget pattern)\n2. Asynchronous cache invalidation running concurrently\n3. Lack of proper ordering guarantees between write and invalidate operations\n\nThe key issue is that setCachedTasks() is called without await and only has error handling:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n```\n\nThis means the cache write operation runs in the background while the function returns immediately. If invalidateTaskCache is called around the same time, we can get the following race conditions:\n1. Write starts → Invalidate starts → Invalidate completes → Write completes (stale data written)\n2. Write starts → Invalidate starts → Write completes → Invalidate completes (cache inconsistency)\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nEdited /Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager/src/services/taskService.ts to add proper await:\n```typescript\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => {\n    logger.error('Cache setting error:', err);\n    throw err; // Propagate error to maintain consistency\n  });\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\nThis change was needed to:\n1. Ensure cache operations complete before returning\n2. Maintain proper ordering of cache operations\n3. Allow proper error propagation for cache consistency\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code pattern is a well-known race condition anti-pattern\n2. The symptom (race condition) matches exactly with the lack of await\n3. The fix follows established patterns for handling async cache operations\n4. The original error message explicitly mentions race condition with invalidateTaskCache"
