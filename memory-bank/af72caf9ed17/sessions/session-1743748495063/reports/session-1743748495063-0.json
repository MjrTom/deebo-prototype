"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition occurs because setCachedTasks is not awaited, allowing cache invalidation to potentially remove the entry before the asynchronous cache write operation completes. The non-atomic sequence of 1) starting async cache write and 2) immediate return of data creates a window where concurrent invalidateTaskCache calls could wipe the cache before it's fully persisted.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the taskService.ts implementation showing unwaited setCachedTasks\n- Verified that the function returns immediately while cache write is still pending\n- The cache operation is not atomic - it's split into an async write and immediate return\n- This creates a clear race condition window between cache write and potential invalidation\n\nKey findings:\n1. The cache write is initiated but not completed before return\n2. No synchronization mechanism exists between cache writes and invalidations\n3. The error handling (.catch) proves the operation is async and continues after return\n4. The immediate return creates a definitive time window for race conditions\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was a validation task, but the hypothesis confirms the root cause\nrequires awaiting the cache operation for atomic behavior.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code pattern exactly matches the hypothesized race condition scenario\n2. The async operation is explicitly not awaited, proving the timing window exists\n3. Error handling shows the operation continues after function return\n4. This matches classic race condition patterns where operations are non-atomic\n5. The comment \"BUG: This is causing a race condition\" directly aligns with our findings"
