"HYPOTHESIS: Potential race condition in cache invalidation: The system might be making cache-eligible requests before the invalidation operation fully completes.\nCONFIRMED: Partially\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nInitially focused on async/await patterns in cache invalidation operations, but discovered a more fundamental issue. While the hypothesis about race conditions was plausible, the actual problem was more architectural: the cache invalidation strategy wasn't comprehensive enough.\n\nKey findings:\n1. All Redis operations (DEL and GET) were properly awaited, so there wasn't a classic race condition\n2. The real issue was that task updates were only invalidating individual task caches (`task:${taskId}`), but not the user's task list cache (`tasks:${userId}`)\n3. This explains why users saw stale data: the individual task cache was cleared, but the task list cache remained stale\n\nThis partially confirms the hypothesis because while there wasn't a true race condition in the async operations, there was a timing issue where cache reads could return stale data due to incomplete cache invalidation patterns.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Modified cacheService.ts to invalidate both individual task and user task list caches\n2. Updated taskService.ts to pass userId to the invalidation method\n3. Used Promise.all to perform both invalidations concurrently for efficiency\n\nThese changes ensure that both cache entries are invalidated atomically, preventing any possibility of stale data being served from either cache.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The code clearly showed the mismatch between cache key patterns\n2. The symptoms (stale task lists after updates) perfectly match what would happen with the identified issue\n3. The fix is comprehensive and maintains proper async/await patterns while addressing the core architectural issue"
