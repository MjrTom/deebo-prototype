"HYPOTHESIS: Cache invalidation occurs before database transaction commit: The task update flow might be invalidating the cache before committing the database transaction. This creates a window where subsequent cache misses fetch stale data from the uncommitted transaction state, repopulating the cache with outdated information before the actual commit occurs.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the transaction flow in taskService.ts and cache handling in cacheService.ts\n- Found that cache invalidation was indeed being called before transaction commit\n- The sequence of operations created a race condition where cache could be populated with stale data\n- Code analysis revealed no transaction isolation level settings that would prevent this issue\n\nKey findings:\n1. Cache invalidation was occurring before transaction commit\n2. No retry mechanism existed for handling potential race conditions\n3. The timing window between invalidation and commit could allow stale data to be cached\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. In taskService.ts:\n   - Reordered operations to ensure transaction commit occurs before cache invalidation\n   - This prevents the race condition where stale data could be cached\n\n2. In cacheService.ts:\n   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for cache reads\n   - This helps handle edge cases where cache reads happen during the commit process\n   - Added maximum retry limit to prevent infinite loops\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe hypothesis was directly confirmed by code analysis showing the incorrect ordering of operations. The fix addresses the core issue by ensuring proper sequencing of database commits and cache invalidation. The added retry mechanism provides additional protection against edge cases. The changes follow established patterns for handling race conditions in distributed systems."
