The setCachedTasks operation could be completing in the first layer but not the second before the response is returned, leading to inconsistent cache states across layers. This would explain why invalidation sometimes appears to work but other times returns stale data.\n</hypothesis>\n\nTo validate this and previous hypotheses, I need to see:\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n  <server_name>filesystem-mcp</server_name>\n  <tool_name>search_files</tool_name>\n  <arguments>\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager\",\n      \"pattern\": \"*Cache*.ts\"\n    }\n  </arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nBased on the error pattern and previous debugging attempts, I can now propose a solution:\n\n<solution>\nThe race condition can be resolved by:\n\n1. Making the cache operations atomic by properly awaiting the setCachedTasks operation:\n```typescript\n// Before returning, await the cache operation\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => {\n    logger.error('Cache setting error:', err);\n    // Optionally invalidate cache on error to prevent inconsistent states\n    return invalidateTaskCache(cacheKey);\n  });\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. Implement a distributed lock mechanism for cache operations:\n```typescript\nconst lock = await acquireLock(cacheKey);\ntry {\n  await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);\n  return paginatedResponse;\n} finally {\n  await releaseLock(lock);\n}\n```\n\n3. Add version tracking to cache entries:\n```typescript\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, {\n  version: await getNextVersion(),\n  data: paginatedResponse\n});\n```\n\nThis solution addresses:\n- The async race condition by properly awaiting cache operations\n- Potential multi-layer cache inconsistencies through atomic operations\n- Prevents parallel writes to the same cache key through locking\n- Adds versioning to detect and handle stale data\n</solution>\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Provide more detailed implementation specifics for any part of the solution?\n2. Explore additional edge cases?\n3. Generate test scenarios to validate the solution?","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
