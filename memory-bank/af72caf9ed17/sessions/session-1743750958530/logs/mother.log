The git history provides crucial information about recent cache-related changes.

The cache version updates might not be properly synchronized with the actual cache operations.\n</hypothesis>\n\nTo proceed further, I need to:\n1. See the cache service implementation\n2. Check how cache operations are integrated with API handlers\n3. Verify the versioning implementation\n\nCould you please:\n1. Share the contents of the cache-related service file?\n2. Confirm if the race condition occurs during specific operations (task updates, bulk operations, etc.)?\n3. Share any error messages or stack traces from when the race condition occurs?\n\nThe commit history suggests this was introduced after removing async/await and adding versioning, so we should focus on those changes first.","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}

Based on the commit history and file structure, here's my current thinking:\n\n<hypothesis type=\"solution-direction\">\nThe race condition likely needs to be fixed by:\n1. Reintroducing async/await for cache operations that are part of larger async flows\n2. Making version updates atomic with their associated cache operations\n3. Implementing a proper locking mechanism around cache+version updates\n4. OR using a transaction-like pattern where cache updates and version increments are atomic\n</hypothesis>\n\nCould you please:\n1. Confirm if you're seeing cache inconsistencies specifically during task updates?\n2. Share any error messages or unexpected behaviors you're seeing?\n3. Let me know if this happens more frequently during bulk operations or single task updates?\n\nThis will help me refine the solution approach.

Reintroducing async/await for cache operations that are part of larger async flows\n2. Making version updates atomic with their associated cache operations\n3. Implementing a proper locking mechanism around cache+version updates\n4. OR using a transaction-like pattern where cache updates and version increments are atomic\n</hypothesis>\n\nCould you please:\n1. Confirm if you're seeing cache inconsistencies specifically during task updates?\n2. Share any error messages or unexpected behaviors you're seeing?\n3.

There are multiple race conditions and bugs in the code. Let me detail them and propose a solution:\n\n<hypothesis type=\"confirmed-issues\">\n1. Double Implementation in getCachedTasks:\n   - There are two try-catch blocks doing the same thing\n   - One uses CacheEntry type, other uses raw type T\n   - This causes inconsistent cache handling\n\n2. Race Condition in updateTask:\n   - invalidateTaskCache() is called non-awaited\n   - Meanwhile getTasks() might be writing to cache\n   - Order of operations is not guaranteed\n\n3. Version Synchronization Issue:\n   - cacheVersion++ is not atomic\n   - Cache operations and version checks aren't synchronized\n   - Multiple simultaneous updates can lead to inconsistent states\n\n4. Cache Key Invalidation Problem:\n   - Key filtering is too restrictive (only \"task:\" and \"tasks:\" prefixes)\n   - Some cache keys might be missed during invalidation\n</hypothesis>\n\n<solution>\nThe solution requires multiple fixes:\n\n1. Fix getCachedTasks implementation:\n```typescript\nexport function getCachedTasks<T>(key: string): T | null {\n  try {\n    const entry = cache.get<CacheEntry<T>>(key);\n    if (!entry) {\n      logger.debug(`Cache miss for key: ${key}`);\n      return null;\n    }\n    if (entry.version !== cacheVersion) {\n      logger.debug(`Cache version mismatch for key: ${key}`);\n      return null;\n    }\n    logger.debug(`Cache hit for key: ${key}`);\n    return entry.data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.error(`Error retrieving from cache for key ${key}:`, error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Make cache operations atomic with a mutex:\n```typescript\nimport mutex from 'async-mutex';\nconst cacheMutex = new mutex.Mutex();\n\nexport async function setCachedTasks<T>(key: string, data: T): Promise<boolean> {\n  const release = await cacheMutex.acquire();\n  try {\n    const entry: CacheEntry<T> = {\n      data,\n      version: cacheVersion,\n      timestamp: Date.now()\n    };\n    return cache.set(key, entry);\n  } finally {\n    release();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Fix invalidation to be atomic and comprehensive:\n```typescript\nexport async function invalidateTaskCache(): Promise<void> {\n  const release = await cacheMutex.acquire();\n  try {\n    cacheVersion++;\n    const keys = cache.keys();\n    // More comprehensive key matching\n    const taskKeys = keys.filter(key => \n      key.includes('task') || \n      key.includes('tasks')\n    );\n    \n    for (const key of taskKeys) {\n      cache.del(key);\n    }\n    logger.debug(`Invalidated ${taskKeys.length} task cache keys, new version: ${cacheVersion}`);\n  } finally {\n    release();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Fix updateTask to properly await cache operations:\n```typescript\nexport async function updateTask(id: number, taskData: TaskUpdateDTO): Promise<Task | null> {\n  // ... existing query code ...\n\n  const result = await pool.query(query, values);\n  if (result.rows.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // Ensure cache invalidation completes before continuing\n  await invalidateTaskCache();\n\n  // Convert and return result\n  const task = convertRowToTask(result.rows[0]);\n  return task;\n}\n```\n\n5. Add proper transaction-like behavior in getTasks:\n```typescript\nexport async function getTasks(\n  filters: TaskFilterOptions = {},\n  pagination: PaginationOptions = { page: 1, limit: 20 }\n): Promise<PaginatedResponse<Task>> {\n  const cacheKey = `tasks:${JSON.stringify({ filters, pagination })}`;\n  \n  // Acquire lock for consistent cache operations\n  const release = await cacheMutex.acquire();\n  try {\n    const cachedResult = await getCachedTasks(cacheKey);\n    if (cachedResult) {\n      return cachedResult;\n    }\n  } finally {\n    release();\n  }\n\n  // ... existing query code ...\n\n  // Atomic cache set with version check\n  await setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);\n  \n  return paginatedResponse;\n}\n```\n</solution>\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Ensure cache operations are atomic\n2. Prevent race conditions between invalidation and updates\n3. Make version updates synchronized with cache operations\n4. Improve cache key matching for invalidation\n5. Fix the duplicate implementation in getCachedTasks\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the solution in more detail or focus on a specific aspect of the fix?","repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
