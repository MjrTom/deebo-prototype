In taskService.ts, the cache setting operation is fire-and-forget:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n.catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. The invalidateTaskCache operation is called immediately after updates/deletes, but it doesn't coordinate with pending cache operations.\n\n3. The specific race condition can occur in this sequence:\n   - Read operation starts and gets fresh data\n   - Update/delete operation occurs and invalidates cache\n   - The original read operation's pending cache update completes, writing now-stale data\n   - Next read gets stale data from cache\n\nThis exactly matches the hypothesis about the timing of cache operations causing stale data to be written after invalidation.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes committed yet, but the solution would require either:\n1. Making cache operations atomic and sequential\n2. Adding version/timestamp checks to prevent older operations from overwriting newer ones\n3. Using await on cache operations to ensure proper sequencing\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n- The code clearly shows the non-atomic cache operations\n- The timing issue matches exactly with the hypothesis\n- The pattern of fire-and-forget cache updates combined with immediate cache invalidation creates a textbook race condition\n- The error symptoms (stale data after updates) align perfectly with the hypothesized behavior\n\nThe investigation confirms not just that the hypothesis is correct, but also provides clear evidence of exactly how the race condition occurs.\n</report>\n\nWould you like me to proceed with implementing one of the suggested solutions to fix this race condition?","refusal":null},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
