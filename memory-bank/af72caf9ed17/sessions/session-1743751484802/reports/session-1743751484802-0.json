"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition likely occurs because setCachedTasks is asynchronous but not awaited, while invalidateTaskCache might be called immediately after in certain scenarios. This could lead to:\n1. Old cache being invalidated\n2. Then the stale data from the previous operation being written to cache\n3. Resulting in inconsistent cache state\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe investigation focused on the interaction between setCachedTasks and invalidateTaskCache operations. Key findings:\n\n1. The current code shows setCachedTasks being called without await:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n.catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. This means the function returns immediately without waiting for the cache operation to complete.\n\n3. The `.catch()` handler confirms it's a Promise-based operation, but it's being \"fire and forget\" style.\n\n4. This creates a perfect scenario for the hypothesized race condition:\n   - If invalidateTaskCache is called right after this function returns\n   - The cache invalidation would complete\n   - Then the original setCachedTasks would complete, overwriting with stale data\n\nThe behavior exactly matches the hypothesis sequence:\n1. setCachedTasks starts but doesn't complete (async operation)\n2. Function returns\n3. invalidateTaskCache runs and completes\n4. Original setCachedTasks finally completes, writing stale data\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the task was to validate the hypothesis, not fix the issue.\nHowever, the fix would involve properly awaiting the setCachedTasks operation:\n```typescript\nawait setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse);\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n\nConfidence is high because:\n1. The code pattern clearly shows an unhandled asynchronous operation\n2. The presence of .catch() confirms it's Promise-based\n3. The sequence of operations matches exactly with the hypothesized race condition\n4. This is a classic example of a race condition pattern where async operations are not properly coordinated"
