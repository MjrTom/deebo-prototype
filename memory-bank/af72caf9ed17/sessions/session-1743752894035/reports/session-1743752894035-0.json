"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition likely occurs when multiple operations are trying to modify the task cache simultaneously. Specifically:\n1. One operation is trying to set/update cached tasks\n2. Another operation is trying to invalidate the cache\n3. There's no proper synchronization mechanism between these operations\n4. This could lead to stale or inconsistent cache state\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined taskService.ts which reveals a simple in-memory caching mechanism using a Map\n- The cache operations are not protected by any synchronization mechanism\n- Key findings in the code:\n  1. The cache is modified in multiple places without atomicity\n  2. Cache invalidation and updates can happen concurrently\n  3. No mutex or lock mechanism is implemented\n  4. Operations that modify the cache are not awaited properly\n\nKey evidence for race condition:\n- Cache updates happen in fire-and-forget style without proper await\n- Cache invalidation doesn't ensure all ongoing cache operations are complete\n- Multiple async operations can interleave their cache access\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as the investigation was focused on confirming the hypothesis rather than fixing the issue.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence of non-atomic cache operations in the code\n2. Lack of any synchronization primitives\n3. Multiple entry points for cache modification\n4. The pattern matches classic race condition scenarios in cache management\n5. The symptoms described (stale/inconsistent cache state) align perfectly with the observed code structure\n\nThe investigation strongly supports the hypothesis that the race condition is caused by lack of synchronization between cache operations. The absence of proper locking mechanisms or atomic operations when updating and invalidating the cache makes this particularly susceptible to race conditions."
