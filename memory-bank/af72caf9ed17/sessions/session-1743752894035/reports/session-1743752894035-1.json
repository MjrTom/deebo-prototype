"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition might be caused by async operations not properly awaiting cache updates:\n1. The cache invalidation might be happening asynchronously\n2. New cache sets might not be waiting for previous invalidations to complete\n3. There could be a missing await on either the set or invalidate operations\n4. The cache might be using a simple object/Map without proper locking mechanisms\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined taskService.ts and cache.ts\n- Found that the cache implementation uses a simple Map object without any synchronization mechanisms\n- Identified multiple async operations interacting with the cache without proper coordination\n- Key issues found:\n  1. Cache invalidation is performed asynchronously but without proper awaiting\n  2. Cache.set() operations run concurrently without waiting for pending invalidations\n  3. No locking mechanism or atomic operations in place\n  4. The Map object being used isn't thread-safe for async operations\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Added atomic operations using async mutex:\n```typescript\n// Added to cache.ts\nimport { Mutex } from 'async-mutex';\n\nexport class Cache<T> {\n  private cache: Map<string, T>;\n  private mutex: Mutex;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.cache = new Map<string, T>();\n    this.mutex = new Mutex();\n  }\n\n  async set(key: string, value: T): Promise<void> {\n    await this.mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n      this.cache.set(key, value);\n    } finally {\n      this.mutex.release();\n    }\n  }\n\n  async invalidate(key: string): Promise<void> {\n    await this.mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n      this.cache.delete(key);\n    } finally {\n      this.mutex.release();\n    }\n  }\n\n  async get(key: string): Promise<T | undefined> {\n    await this.mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n      return this.cache.get(key);\n    } finally {\n      this.mutex.release();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Updated taskService.ts to properly await cache operations:\n```typescript\nasync updateTask(taskId: string, data: TaskUpdateData): Promise<Task> {\n  await this.taskCache.invalidate(taskId);\n  const updatedTask = await this.taskRepo.update(taskId, data);\n  await this.taskCache.set(taskId, updatedTask);\n  return updatedTask;\n}\n```\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasoning:\n1. The original code clearly showed concurrent access to shared state without synchronization\n2. The implementation used a basic Map without any concurrency controls\n3. The pattern of race conditions reported matches exactly with what would happen with async operations on an unprotected cache\n4. The mutex-based solution provides the necessary synchronization guarantees\n5. This is a common pattern in async systems where shared state needs protection\n\nThe fix implements proper async locking mechanisms which directly addresses all four aspects of the original hypothesis. The mutex ensures that cache operations are atomic and properly sequenced, preventing the race conditions identified in the hypothesis."
