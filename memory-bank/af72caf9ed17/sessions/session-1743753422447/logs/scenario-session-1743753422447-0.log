However, based on the hypothesis and context provided, I can still analyze what we know and provide a structured investigation report:\n\n<report>\nHYPOTHESIS: The race condition is likely occurring because multiple async operations are trying to modify the task cache simultaneously without proper synchronization. Specifically:\n1. The code might be making parallel API calls for pagination\n2. Each API response tries to update the cache immediately\n3. There's no mutex or queue system to ensure sequential cache updates\n\nCONFIRMED: Cannot fully confirm due to access limitations, but the hypothesis is LIKELY based on context\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Context Analysis:\n  - The error description specifically mentions tasks being cached immediately after fetching paginated responses\n  - This strongly suggests parallel operations as described in the hypothesis\n  - The mention of \"synchronization issues\" aligns with the hypothesis\n\n- Key Findings:\n  1. The error pattern matches classic race condition symptoms where multiple async operations interact with shared state\n  2. The immediate caching after each paginated response (mentioned in context) supports the hypothesis about lack of synchronization\n  3. Without seeing the code, we can't confirm the exact implementation, but the error pattern strongly suggests the hypothesis is correct\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone - Unable to make changes due to file access limitations\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium\nReasoning:\n1. The error symptoms perfectly match the hypothesized cause\n2. The context explicitly mentions both pagination and immediate caching, which are key elements of the hypothesis\n3. The confidence is not \"High\" only because we couldn't examine the actual code to verify the implementation details\n4. The specific mention of caching tasks \"immediately after fetching a paginated response\" strongly supports the race condition theory\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nWhile we couldn't verify the code, the hypothesis likely points to the correct issue. The solution would involve:\n1. Implementing a queue system for cache updates\n2. Ensuring sequential processing of paginated responses\n3. Adding proper synchronization mechanisms for cache updates\n</report>\n\nI apologize for not being able to examine the actual code, but I've provided an analysis based on the available context and error symptoms. Would you like me to try a different approach to access the source files, or would you like more specific recommendations for potential solutions?","refusal":null},"repoPath":"/Users/sriram/Documents/task-manager"}}
