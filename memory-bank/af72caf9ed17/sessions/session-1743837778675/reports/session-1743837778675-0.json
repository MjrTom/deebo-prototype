"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition likely occurs because setCachedTasks is running asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while invalidateTaskCache could be called immediately after in a different operation. This creates a potential scenario where:\n1. Operation A starts setting cache\n2. Operation B invalidates cache\n3. Operation A finishes setting cache with now-stale data\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nFrom the code analysis, I found clear evidence supporting the hypothesis:\n\n1. The setCachedTasks operation is being called asynchronously but not awaited:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. The catch block handles errors but doesn't prevent the race condition\n3. The code immediately returns paginatedResponse without waiting for the cache operation to complete\n4. This creates exactly the race condition scenario described in the hypothesis where invalidateTaskCache could be called between the start and completion of setCachedTasks\n\nThe code structure confirms that nothing prevents the exact sequence proposed in the hypothesis:\n- Operation A calls setCachedTasks (async operation starts)\n- Operation A returns immediately while cache is still being set\n- Operation B calls invalidateTaskCache\n- Operation A's setCachedTasks finally completes, potentially overwriting the invalidation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as the task was to validate the hypothesis, not fix the issue.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure explicitly shows the non-awaited async operation\n2. The immediate return confirms that cache operations can overlap\n3. The error handling pattern shows the asynchronous nature of the cache operation\n4. There are no synchronization mechanisms in place to prevent the race condition\n5. The code matches exactly the scenario described in the hypothesis\n\nThe actual behavior in the code perfectly matches the theorized race condition sequence from the hypothesis."
