"HYPOTHESIS: The issue could be compounded by multiple cache operations sharing the same cacheKey. If different operations (like list, update, delete) use the same key pattern, they could be interfering with each other's cache states. The lack of awaiting setCachedTasks means we have no guarantees about cache state consistency.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined cache key patterns across task service operations\n- Analyzed the implementation of setCachedTasks and invalidateTaskCache\n- Reviewed the async operation patterns in the caching layer\n\nKey findings:\n1. The cache key pattern is shared across different operations:\n   - List operation uses: `tasks:${userId}:${status}:${page}:${limit}`\n   - Update/Delete operations invalidate using similar patterns\n2. The non-awaited setCachedTasks means the cache write operation continues in the background while:\n   - The response is already returned to the client\n   - Other operations might be modifying the same cache key\n3. There's no synchronization mechanism between cache operations\n4. The invalidateTaskCache operation might run concurrently with setCachedTasks\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n1. Multiple operations are indeed sharing similar cache key patterns\n2. The lack of awaiting setCachedTasks creates a race condition where:\n   - Cache writes might complete after cache invalidations that were triggered later\n   - Cache state becomes inconsistent with the actual data\n   - No guarantees about the order of cache operations\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as the investigation was focused on validating the hypothesis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. Clear evidence of shared cache key patterns\n2. Documented race condition in the code comments\n3. Obvious lack of synchronization between async cache operations\n4. The pattern matches classic race condition scenarios where operations on shared resources aren't properly sequenced\n\nThe issue is particularly problematic because it's not just about one operation being non-awaited, but about multiple operations potentially targeting the same cache keys without any coordination mechanism."
