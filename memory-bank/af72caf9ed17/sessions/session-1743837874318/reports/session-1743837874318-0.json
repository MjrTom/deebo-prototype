"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition is likely occurring because setCachedTasks() is being called asynchronously with .catch() but the function returns immediately without awaiting the cache operation. This means:\n1. The cache write operation is \"fire and forget\"\n2. If invalidateTaskCache() is called shortly after, it could clear the cache while the write is still pending\n3. This creates an inconsistent state where newer data might be overwritten by stale data from the pending cache write\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nThe code analysis revealed several key points:\n1. The setCachedTasks() operation is indeed \"fire and forget\" - the Promise is not being awaited\n2. The .catch() handler only logs errors but doesn't prevent the race condition\n3. The return statement executes immediately, without waiting for the cache operation to complete\n4. The invalidateTaskCache() function can be called at any time, including during the pending cache write\n\nKey findings:\n- The cache write operation is asynchronous but not properly awaited\n- Nothing prevents invalidateTaskCache() from running while a cache write is pending\n- The current implementation allows stale data to potentially overwrite newer data\n- Error handling only logs issues but doesn't address the underlying race condition\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n1. The \"fire and forget\" pattern is clearly visible in the code\n2. There's no synchronization between cache writes and cache invalidation\n3. The sequence of events matches exactly what was hypothesized\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as this was a validation investigation only.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code pattern exactly matches the hypothesized issue\n2. The asynchronous nature of setCachedTasks() is confirmed\n3. There's no mechanism to prevent the race condition between cache writes and invalidation\n4. The timing issue is inherent in the current implementation\n5. The behavior matches classic race condition patterns where operation ordering isn't guaranteed"
