"HYPOTHESIS: The root cause may be deeper than just the async cache write. The caching system appears to lack proper synchronization mechanisms:\n1. There's no atomic \"check-then-set\" operation for the cache\n2. Multiple concurrent requests could be racing to update the same cache key\n3. The cache invalidation might not properly coordinate with ongoing cache writes\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the caching system implementation and found several critical issues that confirm the hypothesis:\n\n1. The cache operations are all asynchronous but lack proper coordination:\n   - setCachedTasks() is called with .catch() but no await\n   - The operation returns before the cache is actually updated\n   - No locking mechanism exists for concurrent operations\n\n2. The invalidation and setting operations can indeed race:\n   - invalidateTaskCache can run while setCachedTasks is in progress\n   - No mechanism exists to track or cancel in-flight cache operations\n   - Cache keys can be overwritten by stale data due to async timing\n\n3. The \"check-then-set\" pattern is missing:\n   - No atomic validation of cache state before updates\n   - Multiple requests can simultaneously decide to update the cache\n   - No version or timestamp checking for cache entries\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nI have not made changes yet, but recommend:\n1. Implementing a distributed locking mechanism for cache operations\n2. Adding version/timestamp metadata to cache entries\n3. Making cache operations atomic using await and proper error handling\n4. Adding a mechanism to track and potentially cancel in-flight cache operations\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe evidence strongly supports all three parts of the hypothesis. The code patterns found in the caching system clearly show the lack of synchronization mechanisms. The race condition isn't just possible - it's practically guaranteed under concurrent load because:\n1. Cache writes are fire-and-forget (no await)\n2. No locking mechanism exists\n3. Cache invalidation has no awareness of in-progress writes\n4. No atomic operations or version control exists\n\nThis matches exactly with the symptoms described and explains the observed race conditions."
