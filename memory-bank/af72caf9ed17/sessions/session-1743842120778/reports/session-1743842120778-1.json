"HYPOTHESIS: The cache invalidation and cache setting operations may be happening in parallel across different requests/operations, with no synchronization mechanism to ensure proper ordering of these operations.\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI analyzed the task service and cache implementation, focusing on the interactions between cache operations. Key findings:\n\n1. The cache operations are asynchronous (Promise-based) but have no synchronization mechanism\n2. The setCachedTasks operation is fire-and-forget (.catch() but no await)\n3. Multiple requests can trigger cache operations simultaneously\n4. The invalidation and setting operations have no coordination between them\n\nThe code shows a classic race condition pattern where:\n- One request could be setting the cache while another is invalidating it\n- The non-awaited setCachedTasks means the operation order isn't guaranteed\n- No locking mechanism exists to prevent concurrent modifications\n\nFor example:\nRequest 1: starts setting cache\nRequest 2: starts invalidating cache\nResult: Final cache state depends on which operation completes last, not the logical order\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes made as this was a validation investigation.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. Clear evidence of async operations without synchronization\n2. The fire-and-forget pattern in setCachedTasks is a known anti-pattern for cache consistency\n3. The comment explicitly mentions this is causing a race condition\n4. No mutex or locking mechanism exists in the cache implementation\n5. The cache operations are Promise-based but not properly coordinated\n\nThe hypothesis matches perfectly with the observed behavior and code structure. The race condition occurs because cache operations can run concurrently without any ordering guarantees or mutual exclusion."
