"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition is occurring because setCachedTasks is being called asynchronously without awaiting its completion, while invalidateTaskCache might be called concurrently. This could lead to:\n1. A stale cache being written after a cache invalidation\n2. Cache inconsistency if multiple tasks are being updated simultaneously\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the task service implementation and cache-related operations\n- Found that setCachedTasks is called without await and with only error logging\n- Discovered that cache invalidation and cache setting can happen concurrently\n- Identified specific scenarios where the race condition occurs:\n  1. When a task is updated/deleted while a getTasks query is in progress\n  2. When multiple getTasks queries run simultaneously with different filters\n\nKey findings:\n1. The current implementation uses fire-and-forget cache setting:\n   ```typescript\n   setCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n     .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n   ```\n2. Cache invalidation happens immediately in update/delete operations\n3. No synchronization mechanism exists between cache operations\n4. The issue can manifest in two ways:\n   - Stale data: When invalidation happens before cache setting completes\n   - Inconsistent state: When multiple cache operations overlap\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis because:\n1. The lack of await means the cache setting continues after the response is returned\n2. No locking mechanism prevents concurrent cache operations\n3. The error handling doesn't prevent the race condition, it just logs errors\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNo changes were made as this was a hypothesis validation task. However, I recommend:\n1. Adding await to setCachedTasks call\n2. Implementing a cache locking mechanism\n3. Using atomic cache operations where possible\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\n- The code clearly shows the asynchronous cache setting without proper synchronization\n- Found multiple potential race condition scenarios in the codebase\n- The implementation matches exactly with the hypothesized issues\n- Cache operations are demonstrably concurrent with no protection mechanism"
