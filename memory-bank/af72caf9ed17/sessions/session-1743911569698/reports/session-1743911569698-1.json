"HYPOTHESIS: The unhandled promise from .catch() could be causing timing issues where errors in cache setting are not properly propagated, leading to inconsistent state between the actual data and cached data\nCONFIRMED: Yes\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the taskService.ts code and related cache operations\n- Found that the cache setting operation was running asynchronously without proper handling\n- The original code continued execution regardless of cache operation success/failure\n- This created a race condition where the cache state could become inconsistent with the returned data\n\nKey findings:\n1. The \"fire and forget\" cache operation could fail silently\n2. No mechanism existed to reconcile cache state on failure\n3. The main function returned before ensuring cache consistency\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Modified taskService.ts to:\n   - Await the cache operation completion\n   - Properly handle cache failures by invalidating the cache\n   - Ensure consistency between returned data and cache state\n   - Added explicit error handling for both cache setting and invalidation\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nThe issue perfectly matches the hypothesis and the fix addresses the core problem by:\n- Ensuring proper promise handling\n- Maintaining cache consistency\n- Preventing race conditions through proper async/await usage\n- Adding proper error recovery mechanisms\n\nThe confidence is high because:\n1. The original code clearly showed the unhandled promise issue\n2. The race condition was demonstrable through the async timing\n3. The fix follows established patterns for handling async operations and maintaining data consistency"
