"HYPOTHESIS: The core issue is likely in the execution order and promise handling:\n1. The current code returns paginatedResponse immediately without awaiting setCachedTasks\n2. This means that subsequent operations (including possible cache invalidations) can occur before the cache is actually set\n3. If invalidateTaskCache is called right after this function returns but before setCachedTasks completes, we could end up with:\n   - Cache being invalidated\n   - Old data being written to cache after invalidation\n   - Resulting in stale data persisting in cache\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\nI examined the taskService.ts and related cache management code. The key findings support the hypothesis:\n\n1. The code indeed shows a clear race condition where setCachedTasks is called but not awaited:\n```typescript\nsetCachedTasks(cacheKey, paginatedResponse)\n  .catch(err => logger.error('Cache setting error:', err));\n\nreturn paginatedResponse;\n```\n\n2. The cache invalidation function `invalidateTaskCache` is used in various places throughout the codebase, and any of these calls occurring between the initiation of setCachedTasks and its completion would trigger the race condition.\n\n3. The caching operation is asynchronous (returns a Promise) but isn't being properly waited for, which is essential for maintaining cache consistency.\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n1. The cache setting operation is a fire-and-forget promise that's only handled for errors\n2. There's no synchronization between cache writes and invalidations\n3. The error handling (.catch) confirms setCachedTasks is asynchronous, making the race condition possible\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone made yet - verification phase only\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code pattern exactly matches the hypothesized issue\n2. The presence of .catch() confirms setCachedTasks is Promise-based\n3. The lack of await means the promise resolution timing is unpredictable\n4. This is a classic race condition pattern where asynchronous operations are not properly coordinated\n5. The error comment specifically mentions a race condition with invalidateTaskCache, which aligns perfectly with the observed code behavior"
