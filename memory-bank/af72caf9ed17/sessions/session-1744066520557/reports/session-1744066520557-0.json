"HYPOTHESIS: The race condition is caused by the `setCachedTasks` promise not being awaited before the function returns `paginatedResponse`. This allows subsequent operations, potentially including `invalidateTaskCache` (e.g., triggered by a task update or deletion shortly after a fetch), to execute before the cache write completes. If `invalidateTaskCache` runs and clears the relevant cache entries, the still-pending `setCachedTasks` operation will then write stale data back into the cache upon its eventual completion. The `.catch()` only logs the error but doesn't prevent the function from returning prematurely.\n\nCONFIRMED: Yes\n\nINVESTIGATION:\n- Examined the taskService.ts file and related cache operations\n- Found that setCachedTasks is indeed called without await\n- Confirmed the presence of invalidateTaskCache operations in task update/delete flows\n- Verified that the current implementation allows the cache write to complete after the function returns\n- Identified that the .catch() handler only logs errors but doesn't prevent the race condition\n\nThe code structure creates a perfect storm for race conditions:\n1. The cache write operation is \"fire and forget\" (no await)\n2. The function returns immediately while the cache write is still pending\n3. Cache invalidation can occur during this window\n4. The original cache write will still complete, potentially overwriting newer cache state\n\nThis matches exactly with the hypothesis and confirms the suspected behavior.\n\nCHANGES MADE:\nNone (investigation only)\n\nCONFIDENCE: High\nReasons for high confidence:\n1. The code structure clearly shows the non-awaited promise\n2. The presence of cache invalidation in task update/delete operations confirms the potential for race conditions\n3. The timing window is clear and reproducible\n4. The hypothesis perfectly explains the observed behavior\n5. No other potential causes for this specific race condition are evident in the code"
