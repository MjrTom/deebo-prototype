the activeContext.md is like Mother's working memory/journal that helps her create increasingly well-informed scenario agents as the investigation progresses. She can learn from and build upon previous hypotheses and scenario results.

🤖 Scenario Agent Behavior
	•	Stateless.
	•	Does not know or care about the memory bank.
	•	Just prints to stdout.
	•	The system infra (like writeReport() or logger plumbing) captures this and dumps it into the session folder under memory-bank.

Important: writeReport() is a utility that happens to write to memory-bank paths. The agent never references memory-bank directly. It just formats its output and logs it.

⸻

👩‍🍼 Mother Agent Behavior
	•	Optionally informed of the memory bank (useMemoryBank).
	•	Only mandatory behavior: append to progress.md at session end.
	•	Can optionally read/write activeContext.md during OODA loop.
	•	Never required to consult memory-bank during planning. It’s just available.

⸻

✳️ Clarifications
	•	scenario-agent.ts is not “aware” of memory-bank — it does not contain paths or logic for it. It uses writeReport() as a dumb output function.
	•	This means memory write is a side effect of infrastructure — not agent intent.
	•	That’s what keeps agents stateless and composable.
