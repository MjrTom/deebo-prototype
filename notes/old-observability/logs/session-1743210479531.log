To properly help investigate this issue, I'll need:\n\n1. Access to view the relevant code files\n2. Information about:\n   - How the task cache is currently implemented\n   - Any concurrent operations that might be affecting the cache\n   - Specific symptoms of the race condition (timing, frequency, impact)\n\nCould you please:\n1. Grant necessary permissions to access the code files, or\n2. Share the relevant code snippets, particularly:\n   - Task service implementation\n   - Cache management logic\n   - Any concurrent operations\n   - Error logs or stack traces related to the race condition\n\nThis will help me provide more specific guidance on fixing the race condition. In general, solutions might involve:\n1. Using proper locking mechanisms\n2. Implementing atomic operations\n3. Using thread-safe data structures\n4. Adding proper synchronization points\n5. Implementing optimistic locking\n\nPlease provide additional context or adjust permissions so I can offer more specific assistance."}}

This is preventing me from directly viewing the code related to the race condition in task cache management.\n\nGiven this limitation, let me explain how I would approach investigating and fixing a race condition in task cache management based on general best practices:\n\n1. Race Condition in Task Cache Management typically occurs when:\n- Multiple threads/processes try to access and modify the task cache simultaneously\n- There's no proper synchronization mechanism in place\n- Cache reads and writes are not atomic operations\n\nCommon solutions include:\n\n1. Implementing Mutex/Lock mechanisms:\n```typescript\nclass TaskCache {\n  private cache = new Map();\n  private mutex = new Mutex(); // Using a mutex library\n\n  async getTask(id: string) {\n    await this.mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n      return this.cache.get(id);\n    } finally {\n      this.mutex.release();\n    }\n  }\n\n  async setTask(id: string, task: Task) {\n    await this.mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n      this.cache.set(id, task);\n    } finally {\n      this.mutex.release();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Using atomic operations:\n```typescript\nclass TaskCache {\n  private cache = new Map();\n  \n  async updateTask(id: string, updateFn: (task: Task) => Task) {\n    // Atomic read-modify-write operation\n    const task = this.cache.get(id);\n    const updatedTask = await updateFn(task);\n    this.cache.set(id, updatedTask);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Implementing proper locking with timeouts:\n```typescript\nclass TaskCache {\n  private cache = new Map();\n  private locks = new Map();\n\n  async withLock(id: string, operation: () => Promise<void>) {\n    if (this.locks.get(id)) {\n      throw new Error('Resource busy');\n    }\n    \n    this.locks.set(id, true);\n    try {\n      await operation();\n    } finally {\n      this.locks.delete(id);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo properly investigate and fix this issue, I would need to:\n\n1. Examine the current task cache implementation\n2. Look for concurrent access patterns\n3. Review error logs for any cache inconsistencies\n4. Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms\n5. Add proper error handling\n6. Add logging to track cache operations\n7. Add unit tests for concurrent scenarios\n\nWould you be able to provide access to:\n1. The task cache implementation code\n2. Any error logs related to the race condition\n3. The current test suite\n\nThis would help me provide more specific recommendations for fixing the race condition."}}

Race Condition Overview:\nRace conditions in task cache management typically occur when multiple operations try to access and modify the cache simultaneously, leading to potential data inconsistencies.\n\nCommon scenarios that could cause this:\n- Multiple tasks being added/removed from cache concurrently\n- Cache updates happening while reading cache data\n- Cache invalidation occurring during cache access\n\nTo properly investigate this, I would need to:\n1. Review the task service implementation\n2. Check how cache operations are synchronized\n3. Look for concurrent access patterns\n\nWould you be able to:\n1. Share the relevant code from taskService.ts?\n2. Provide any error logs or stack traces related to the race condition?\n3. Describe the symptoms you're seeing (e.g., inconsistent task states, missing tasks, etc.)?\n\nThis would help me provide more specific guidance on fixing the race condition.\n\nCommon solutions might involve:\n1. Using mutex locks for cache operations\n2. Implementing atomic operations\n3. Using thread-safe data structures\n4. Adding proper synchronization mechanisms\n\nBut I'd need to see the actual implementation to recommend the most appropriate solution."}}
