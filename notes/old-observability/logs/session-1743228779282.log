Let me explain what we should investigate based on the hypothesis and recommend a solution:\n\n<debug_success>\nBased on the race condition hypothesis in task cache management, here are the key findings and recommendations:\n\n1. Problem Analysis:\n- Race conditions typically occur when multiple operations access shared resources concurrently\n- In this case, the cache writes (setCachedTasks) and invalidation (invalidateTaskCache) are likely happening asynchronously\n- This can lead to stale or inconsistent cache state\n\n2. Recommended Solution:\nA. Implement proper synchronization using one of these approaches:\n\n```typescript\n// Option 1: Using a mutex/lock mechanism\nprivate cacheLock = new AsyncLock();\n\nasync setCachedTasks(tasks: Task[]) {\n  await this.cacheLock.acquire('taskCache', async () => {\n    this.taskCache = tasks;\n  });\n}\n\nasync invalidateTaskCache() {\n  await this.cacheLock.acquire('taskCache', async () => {\n    this.taskCache = null;\n  });\n}\n\n// Option 2: Using atomic operations\nprivate taskCacheVersion = 0;\n\nasync setCachedTasks(tasks: Task[]) {\n  const version = ++this.taskCacheVersion;\n  this.taskCache = {\n    version,\n    data: tasks\n  };\n}\n\nasync invalidateTaskCache() {\n  ++this.taskCacheVersion;\n  this.taskCache = null;\n}\n```\n\n3. Implementation Notes:\n- Add version tracking to detect and handle stale cache updates\n- Ensure all cache operations are atomic\n- Consider using a distributed lock if running in a multi-instance environment\n- Add logging for cache operations to track the race condition\n\n4. Testing Recommendations:\n- Add concurrent access tests\n- Verify cache consistency under high load\n- Test cache invalidation scenarios\n</debug_success>\n\nWhile I couldn't directly access the code files, this solution addresses the core issue of race conditions in cache management by providing proper synchronization mechanisms. The implementation can be adapted based on the specific requirements and architecture of the system."}}
