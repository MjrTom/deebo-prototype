  "explanation": "I'm fixing the race condition by making two key changes:\n\n1. In updateTask(), replacing the setTimeout-based cache invalidation with an immediate awaited call to invalidateTaskCache(). This ensures the cache is invalidated before the function returns.\n\n2. In getTasks(), making the setCachedTasks call awaited instead of fire-and-forget. This ensures proper ordering of operations.\n\nThese changes ensure that:\n- Cache invalidation happens synchronously and immediately when a task is updated\n- Cache setting is properly awaited before returning results\n- There's no race condition between cache invalidation and setting\n\nThe original code had potential for stale data because:\n- Cache invalidation was deferred via setTimeout\n- Cache setting was not awaited\n\nThis fix creates a predictable order of operations and prevents stale data from being cached.",
