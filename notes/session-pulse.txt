* Scenario: session-1743837874318-0
  Status: Reported
  Hypothesis: "The race condition is likely occurring because setCachedTasks() is being called asynchronously with .catch() but the function returns immediately without awaiting the cache operation. This means:

1. The cache write operation is "fire and forget"
2. If invalidateTaskCache() is called shortly after, it could clear the cache while the write is still pending
3. This creates an inconsistent state where newer data might be overwritten by stale data from the pending cache write"

* Scenario: session-1743837874318-1
  Status: Reported
  Hypothesis: "The root cause may be deeper than just the async cache write. The caching system appears to lack proper synchronization mechanisms:

1. There's no atomic "check-then-set" operation for the cache
2. Multiple concurrent requests could be racing to update the same cache key
3. The cache invalidation might not properly coordinate with ongoing cache writes"
