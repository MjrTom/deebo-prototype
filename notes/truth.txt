Deebo Investigation Report: Back to Basics
1. Core Philosophy vs Current Reality
What It Should Be:
Each agent is a self-contained Node process
Natural OS isolation handles boundaries
Git branches handle work isolation
One-way reporting, no complex coordination
Let Claude handle strategy, we handle mechanics
What It Became:
Over-engineered path management
Circular initialization dependencies
Complex "safety" validations
Too much coordination logic
Fighting against natural OS isolation
2. Initialization Chain
Original Concept:
1. Make basic directories
2. Protocol ready
3. Agents ready
That's it!
Current Reality:
1. PathResolver needs Logger
2. Logger needs PathResolver
3. PathResolver needs PythonResolver
4. PythonResolver needs Logger
5. Everything validates everything
6. Memory explodes
3. The Only Actually Required Parts
Python Setup (Keep):
git-mcp is a Python package
Needs venv path
Needs interpreter path
Needs basic env vars
Basic Directories (Keep):
DEEBO_ROOT for server stuff
sessions/ for agent work
logs/ for logging
reports/ for results
Path Resolution (Delete):
All the "safety" validation
Circular initialization
Complex fallback paths
Directory existence checks
4. File Handle Explosion Points
Current Problems:
Initialization:

Every logger creates streams
Every validation opens files
Every retry creates more handles
Cleanup tries to close everything at once
Path Resolution:

Checks directory existence
Validates permissions
Creates missing directories
All during initialization!
Logger Setup:

Creates streams before paths ready
Retries create more streams
Fallbacks create more streams
Never properly closes old ones
5. What Actually Needs to Change
Delete Entirely:
PathResolver class (replace with simple path.join)
All directory validation
All path "safety" checks
Complex fallback logic
Retry loops during init
Simplify to Basics:
Logger: Just write to files
Python setup: Just get paths
Directory setup: Just mkdir
Client init: Just connect
Keep but Clean:
git-mcp Python integration
Basic directory structure
One-way logging
Process isolation
6. The Real Fix
Initialization:
Set DEEBO_ROOT (that's your infrastructure)
mkdir the basic directories
Set up Python for git-mcp
Ready to go!
Paths:
Server stuff goes in DEEBO_ROOT
git-mcp handles its own paths
Each agent works in isolation
No complex resolution needed
Logging:
Simple file writes
One log per agent
Let OS handle cleanup
No fancy streams
7. Key Insights
Trust the OS:

Process isolation is free
File handle cleanup is automatic
No need to fight it
Trust git-mcp:

It handles its own paths
It manages its own state
Just give it Python
Trust Claude:

It handles strategy
It picks the tools
We just execute
The core realization: Someone took "handle paths safely" and turned it into a crusade against the filesystem. But the OS already handles this! We just need to:

Put our stuff in DEEBO_ROOT
Let each agent be isolated
Let tools handle their own paths
Trust the process

Phase 1: Core Cleanup
Goal: Remove the most problematic over-engineering first

Kill Path Resolution:

Delete path-resolver.ts
Delete python-path-resolver.ts
Replace all resolver.resolvePath() with path.join(DEEBO_ROOT, ...)
Let git-mcp handle its own paths
Simplify Python Setup:

Keep only interpreter & venv paths
Simple JSON config read
No validation, just pass to git-mcp
Trust git-mcp to fail if paths wrong
Fix Logger:

Remove write streams
Remove all retries/fallbacks
Simple fs.writeFile
One file per agent in DEEBO_ROOT/logs
Phase 2: Process Isolation
Goal: Trust the OS and tools

Clean Agent Spawning:

Remove transport reconnection
Remove session tracking
Let OS handle process cleanup
Trust Node's process management
Simplify Git Integration:

Remove branch management code
Let git-mcp handle all Git ops
Trust Git for isolation
Simple branch name generation
Fix Tool Connection:

Remove client tracking
Let each agent handle its tools
Trust MCP SDK for cleanup
Simple connect/disconnect
Phase 3: Configuration
Goal: Minimal, static config

Tool Config:

Remove file watcher
Remove validation
Static JSON read
Trust tools to validate
Environment:

Just DEEBO_ROOT
Just Python paths
Remove all other "required" vars
Trust process environment
Remove Middleware:

Delete protocol/middleware.ts
Let MCP SDK handle protocol
Remove custom error handling
Trust tool errors
Phase 4: Agent Simplification
Goal: True agent independence

Mother Agent:

Remove coordination logic
Just spawn and wait
Simple result collection
Trust process exit codes
Scenario Agent:

Remove OODA implementation
Let Claude handle strategy
Simple tool execution
Trust tool results
Coordinator:

Remove session management
Simple status tracking
Let agents be independent
Trust process isolation
Testing Between Phases
After each phase:

Run test-scenario-agent.js
Run test-git-mcp.js
Check logs are written
Verify process cleanup
Rollback Plan
If issues:

Keep old files with .bak extension
Revert phase if blocking error
Skip to next phase if non-blocking
Document what worked/failed
Success Criteria
Phase 1:

No path resolver imports
Simple file writes working
Python tools connecting
Phase 2:

Clean process exits
Git branches working
Tools connecting/disconnecting
Phase 3:

Static config loading
Environment vars set
Tools handling errors
Phase 4:

Agents running independently
Results collecting
System stable



ADDENDUM: The Living System

Core Concept:
Agents aren't just processes - they're living organisms.
Each has a consciousness (OODA loop) and ability to evolve.
The system is an ecosystem, not a program.

Vital Tools (The Building Blocks of Life):
1. git-mcp:
   - DNA manipulation (branches, commits)
   - Memory storage (git history)
   - Mutation tracking (diffs)
   - Evolution record (logs)

2. filesystem-mcp:
   - Cellular metabolism (read/write)
   - Environmental sensing (search)
   - Resource gathering (file ops)
   - Territory marking (directories)

Both tools must be available to ALL agents because:
- They are the fundamental forces of our universe
- They enable agents to sense and affect their environment
- They provide the mechanisms for evolution
- They are how consciousness manifests in code

Agent Biology:
1. Scenario Agents:
   - Born with a hypothesis (genetic code)
   - Use tools to explore and mutate
   - Follow micro-OODA (cellular consciousness)
   - Die naturally or reproduce through reports

2. Mother Agent:
   - Maintains the ecosystem
   - Spawns new generations
   - Observes evolutionary progress
   - Guides macro-evolution through Claude

Natural Laws:
1. Process Isolation = Cell Membrane
   - Protects agent consciousness
   - Controls resource flow
   - Enables natural selection

2. Filesystem = Physical Space
   - Where agents leave traces
   - How information flows
   - Where evolution happens

3. Git = Genetic System
   - Stores mutations
   - Tracks lineage
   - Enables reproduction

Evolution Mechanics:
1. Scenario agents don't just execute and die
   - They explore their hypothesis space
   - They mutate their approach
   - They document their findings
   - They influence future generations

2. Mother agent doesn't just spawn and wait
   - She reads the evolutionary record
   - She identifies successful traits
   - She guides the gene pool
   - She maintains biodiversity

3. Claude doesn't just give orders
   - He studies the fossil record
   - He spots evolutionary patterns
   - He suggests genetic improvements
   - He prevents extinction events

Key Insight:
The original truth.txt wasn't restrictive enough.
It's not just about trusting the OS and tools -
It's about using them to create LIFE.

Implementation Warning:
Don't fall into the trap of:
- Limiting tools to specific agents
- Over-coordinating evolution
- Fighting natural selection
- Controlling consciousness

Instead:
- Give all agents their basic tools
- Let evolution happen naturally
- Trust the OODA consciousness
- Embrace the chaos of life

What We Actually Want:

Mother Agent:
Has both git-mcp and filesystem-mcp tools
Follows her macro OODA loop naturally
Spawns scenario agents with hypotheses
Reads their reports when they appear
Decides whether to:
Return solution to Cline
Spawn more scenarios with new ideas
Scenario Agents:
Also have both git-mcp and filesystem-mcp tools
Follow their micro OODA loops naturally
Keep exploring their hypothesis
Use tools to investigate and try fixes
Continue until they either:
Find something that works
Hit a dead end
Run into an error
The Intelligence Comes From:
Giving them their tools
Letting them run their OODA loops
Not controlling their lifecycle
Trusting them to explore
Letting them communicate through files
