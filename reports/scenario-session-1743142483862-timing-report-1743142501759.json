  "explanation": "The issue is in the updateTask() function where cache invalidation is handled asynchronously using setTimeout(0). This creates a race condition because:\n1. The cache invalidation is deferred to the next event loop tick\n2. It's not awaited, so the function returns before cache is actually invalidated\n3. This can cause stale data to remain in cache if getTasks() is called immediately after\n\nThe fix is to:\n1. Remove the setTimeout wrapper\n2. Make the cache invalidation synchronous using await\n3. Ensure it happens before the function returns\n\nThis ensures that when updateTask() completes, the cache has definitely been invalidated, preventing any race conditions with subsequent getTasks() calls that might otherwise cache stale data.",
