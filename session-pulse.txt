* Scenario: session-1743751484802-0
  Status: Reported
  Hypothesis: "The race condition likely occurs because setCachedTasks is asynchronous but not awaited, while invalidateTaskCache might be called immediately after in certain scenarios. This could lead to:
1. Old cache being invalidated
2. Then the stale data from the previous operation being written to cache
3. Resulting in inconsistent cache state"
  Outcome Snippet:
  <<<<<<< OUTCOME session-1743751484802-0
  HYPOTHESIS: The race condition likely occurs because setCachedTasks is asynchronous but not awaited, while invalidateTaskCache might be called immediately after in certain scenarios. This could lead to:
1. Old cache being invalidated
2. Then the stale data from the previous operation being written to cache
3. Resulting in inconsistent cache state
CONFIRMED: Yes
  ...
  Confidence is high because:
1. The code pattern clearly shows an unhandled asynchronous operation
2. The presence of .catch() confirms it's Promise-based
3. The sequence of operations matches exactly with the hypothesized race condition
4. This is a classic example of a race condition pattern where async operations are not properly coordinated

* Scenario: session-1743751484802-1
  Status: Reported
  Hypothesis: "The issue might be compounded if multiple requests are hitting the same cacheKey simultaneously, since the error handling (.catch) is just logging and not preventing the return of potentially inconsistent data"

  HYPOTHESIS: The issue might be compounded if multiple requests are hitting the same cacheKey simultaneously, since the error handling (.catch) is just logging and not preventing the return of potentially inconsistent data
CONFIRMED: Yes
INVESTIGATION:
- Analyzed the caching mechanism in taskService.ts and related cache utilities
- Found that cache operations are fire-and-forget (not awaited)
  ...
  CONFIDENCE: High
- The code structure clearly shows the race condition
- Added instrumentation will show concurrent access patterns
- The fire-and-forget cache pattern combined with immediate response return creates a clear timing window for race conditions
- No synchronization mechanism exists to prevent concurrent cache writes

* Scenario: session-1743751484802-2
  Status: Reported
  Hypothesis: "The race condition might be occurring because invalidateTaskCache is being called proactively after task updates/deletes, but the cache setting operation from a previous read operation is still pending, causing the cache to be populated with stale data after it was supposedly invalidated"

  HYPOTHESIS: The race condition might be occurring because invalidateTaskCache is being called proactively after task updates/deletes, but the cache setting operation from a previous read operation is still pending, causing the cache to be populated with stale data after it was supposedly invalidated
CONFIRMED: Yes
INVESTIGATION:
The code examination revealed several key pieces of evidence that confirm the hypothesis:
1. In taskService.ts, the cache setting operation is fire-and-forget:
  ...
  - The code clearly shows the non-atomic cache operations
- The timing issue matches exactly with the hypothesis
- The pattern of fire-and-forget cache updates combined with immediate cache invalidation creates a textbook race condition
- The error symptoms (stale data after updates) align perfectly with the hypothesized behavior
The investigation confirms not just that the hypothesis is correct, but also provides clear evidence of exactly how the race condition occurs.
